<h2 class="fs130">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>This little volume will prove of interest to the general reader
and of inestimable value to the student or teacher of history.
It contains graphic descriptions of the seventeen great struggles
of the historic past&mdash;Marathon, Arbela, Zama, Teutobergerwald,
Adrianople, Chalons, Tours, Senlac-Hastings, Orleans, Lepanto,
Spanish Armada, Naseby, Blenheim, Pultowa, Saratoga, Valmy,
and Waterloo. Dates, figures, facts, estimates and reflections
are presented in attractive form; and the net results of long
research labor are given in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Those terrific conflicts of the past seem strangely fascinating
when looked at in their crucial throes ere yet they are stamped
with the die of destiny. The thoughtful mind asks, “Would
our world of today be just what it is if all or if any one of
these battles had borne results the reverse of what they did bear?”</p>

<span class="fs130">MARATHON</span></h2>


<p>As in the order of time, so likewise in the order of importance,
Marathon stands first among the Battles of Destiny. Without
Marathon there would have been no Thermopylæ, Salamis,
Platæa, Mycale; no Attic supremacy; no Age of Pericles: and
would the world be just what it is today if these things had
not been? Would Attica as a Persian satrapy ever have become
Athens of the Acropolis crowned with the Propylaea-Erectheum-Parthenon:
Athens bright star-night of the past glittering with
deathless names?</p>

<p>Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia had risen and set; Rome
subsequently rose and fell; France, Italy, Spain, England, Germany,
and our own infantine experimental Republic of the
West are advancing fatefully in the old circle: yet not one of
these may boast as many eminent men, stars of first magnitude,
glorious constellations&mdash;as little Greece might boast, that brief
bright star-night of the past thick-studded with immortal names.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Callimachus, War Ruler.</span></h3>

<p>Of the ten commanders of the ten Athenian tribes who assembled
on the heights overlooking the plain of Marathon, five
voted against battle with the invading Persians, five in favor of
battle. Callimachus the War Ruler, influenced by the enthusiastic
eloquence of Miltiades, gave the casting vote in favor of
battle. On this so seeming slight chance hung Marathon.</p>

<p>Humanly speaking, it was madness for that little handful
of Greeks to rush down upon the countless Persian hosts. The
Persians themselves could not believe their own eyes when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
saw the Greeks running to battle; and half-heartedly, perhaps
even jestingly, they prepared for a brief skirmish with madmen.</p>

<p>The Medes and Persians were at that time deemed invincible.
Babylonia, Assyria, Asia Minor, the isles of the Ægean, the
African Coast, the Euxine, Thrace, Macedonia had successively
fallen before the soldiers of the Great King. The Ægean was a
Persian Lake; from east, from south, from north approached
the awful power of imperial Persia, ready irresistibly to absorb
little Greece, to punish and obliterate Athens. Already the
Eretrians, who together with the Athenians had aided in the
Ionian revolt, were overtaken by the dread vengeance of Darius:
their city had fallen and more than a thousand Eretrians were
left bound on the island Egilia awaiting the return of the victorious
Persian fleet from Marathon. Then together with the
captive Athenians, the Eretrians were to be taken to Susa there
to await the pleasure of the Great King, whose wrath had been
new-kindled day by day with memories of burning Sardis by
a court attendant whose sole duty was to repeat to Darius at
each meal, “Sire, remember the Athenians.” Sardis would
then be fearfully avenged.</p>

<p>Sardis was, indeed, avenged but not by Marathon. There is
a justice exact even to the weight of a hair in all things of life;
seen or unseen, known or unknown, acknowledged or unacknowledged,
it is ever at work silently, forcefully, fatefully. Athens
burns Sardis and desecrates the temples of the Persian gods;
and some years later the Persians sack and devastate Athens,
razing her temples to the ground leaving her site in smoking
ruins.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Behold there are Watchers over you, worthy Recorders,
knowing what you do: and whosoever shall have wrought
an ant’s weight of good shall behold it; and whosoever shall
have wrought an ant’s weight of evil shall behold it.”&mdash;<cite>Koran.</cite></p></div>

<p>History tells us that after the battle of Marathon, six thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
four hundred Persians lay dead upon the battlefield and
only one hundred and ninety-two Athenians. This seems incredible,
yet it is equally incredible that the Greeks won. Ten
thousand Athenians and one thousand Platæans had fought
against one hundred thousand soldiers of the Great King, and&mdash;won.
There was something wrong with that motley army of
the Great King; some subtly retributive force was at work,
some balancing Justice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Miltiades.</span></h3>

<p>Doubtless to Miltiades more than to any other man Athens
and the world owes Marathon. It was his overpowering eloquence
that weighed heavily in the balance against the honest
fears of those who dreaded the encounter with Persia’s hitherto
invincible warriors; the well founded fears of those who were
secretly in sympathy with Hippias and hoped that a battle
might be averted: and the prudent fears of those who dreaded
defeat and the vengeance of the Great King and thought it
wiser to wait until the promised help should come from Sparta.
One man’s eloquent fearlessness outweighed all those fearful
considerations and precipitated the mad descent from the hill,
the onslaught, the unequal fight, the wonder-victory.</p>

<p>Yet had Miltiades rested after the momentous battle all
might have been lost. For the sullen Persian fleet hastening
from Marathon had turned its course towards undefended
Athens. And so that very night, even with the departure of the
last Persian ship from the shore, Miltiades led his battle torn
veterans a distance of about twenty-two miles to Phalerum, the
port nearest to Athens. And early the next morning when, indeed,
true to Miltiades’ fears, the Persian fleet appeared off the
coast of Phalerum, the men of Marathon stood awaiting their
landing. They did not land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Hippias, deposed tyrant of Athens, and guide and leader of
the Persians was killed at Marathon. Callimachus, the polemarch,
was killed, not in the battle proper, but on the shore as
the defeated forces were confusedly seeking safety in escape to
their ships, and the Greeks, following them even to the water’s
edge, kept up the slaughter.</p>

<p>Surely Miltiades remained ever after the best beloved hero
of Athens, and his years passed on amid ever vernal honors
down the easy ways of old age, and the end was in peace!</p>

<p>But, alas! history tells us that Miltiades fell into disgrace,
was banished from Athens, and a few years after Marathon, died
of his wounds in prison.</p>

<p>Too bad that every crest-wave of human achievement hastily
tumbles to a depression correspondingly low as the swell was high.
Scipio, conqueror at Zama, triumph-crowned, and honored with
the appellation <em>Africanus</em>, was, on that same day one year later
on trial for his life. What a tumult of conflicting feelings must
have raged in his heart when, disdaining to reply to the accusations
made against him, Scipio said, turning to the fickle
populace, “I would remind the men of Rome that this day one
year ago I won the battle of Zama.” And then the tide turned
in his favor and the young-world children wept because of their
ingratitude, and clamorously acquitted Scipio. But depressive
doubt succeeded crest confidence and Scipio went into exile.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingrata Patria!</i> (Ungrateful Native Land!) Scipio exclaimed, as
death drew near and his tired eyes turned longingly towards
Rome.</p>

<p>Coriolanus, Roman exile, torn to pieces by the Volscians;
Hannibal, lone boast of Carthage, hater of Rome; Themistocles,
hero of Salamis; Aristides the Just; Socrates; Miltiades are
among the tragic figures on the historic stage whose dying heart-throbs
may have reproachfully re-echoed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingrata Patria</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">All the Glory That Was Greece.</span></h3>

<p>From Marathon (490 B. C.) clarion of the birth of Athens,
to Ægospotami (405 B. C.) her knell of death, momentous history
was made.</p>

<p>Ægospotami knelled the fall of Athens; Leuctra, of Sparta;
Mantinea, of Epaminondas-Thebes; and Chæronea, of all Hellas;
but not all of Athens died at Ægospotami. Pericles, Aspasia,
Phidias, Ictinus, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Æschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon&mdash;have
not died; they are effective forces in the world today.</p>

<p>Spartan military excellence, Spartan hardihood and endurance
is a bubble that burst; it is no more: but Attic excellence
of intellect endures imperishably&mdash;with Platonic wonder as
freshly fair in college halls today as in the Academia and Lyceum
of the old Athenian day. Mind is the only Conqueror.</p>

<p>Blue sky of Athens, white cliff Acropolis,&mdash;so unchanging
amid change, so laughing fair among the ruins of the glory that
was Greece!</p>

<p>Nature’s ever young irreverence towards the wreck of time is
invigorating. It calls to the heart of man in language the
heart understands, <em>What’s Time</em>!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Men said, ‘But time escapes</p>
<p class="verse4">Live now or never.’</p>
<p class="verse">“He said, ‘What’s time! Leave Now for dogs and apes&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse4">Man has Forever.’”</p>
<p class="verse16">&mdash;<cite>Browning.</cite></p>
</div></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sparta.</span></h3>

<p>The manner in which the news of the defeat of the Athenians
at Ægospotami affected Athens is in striking contrast with
the manner in which Sparta received word of the disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Spartan defeat at Leuctra. When report of the naval disaster
reached the Piræus, it was quickly communicated to the thronging
crowds within the Long Walls, and thence to the heart of
the city. Consternation prevailed and all Athens mourned.
“That night,” says Xenophon, “no one in Athens slept.”</p>

<p>The news of the defeat at Leuctra reached Sparta in the
midst of a festive celebration. The magistrates heard of the
defeat, and the death of their king, with countenances unmoved;
they gave orders that the festival be uninterrupted; and they
urged all who had lost relatives and friends in the battle of
Leuctra to appear at the festivities in particularly gay attire
and with smiling faces, while those whose relatives were among
the survivors were ordered to put on mourning.</p>

<p>The spirit of Lycurgus, of Draco, and of Leonidas seems to
have fused and chilled into the Laws of Sparta. No surrender;
conquer or die; return with your shield or upon it; wounds all
in front and faces grimly fierce even in death&mdash;such was the
spirit of Sparta.</p>

<p>Whatever may be our admiration for the Spartan qualities
in general, there can be but lament that they found expression
in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Peloponessian War'">Peloponnesian War</ins>.
This <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fractricidal strife'">fratricidal strife</ins> brought ruin
to Hellas. Marathon, Thermopylæ, Salamis, Platæa, Mycale
were all undone by Syracuse and Ægospotami. Chæronea was
made possible and the passing of the scepter of empire from
Greece to Macedonia, from leaderless Hellas to Alexander the

<span class="fs130">ARBELA</span></h2>


<p>The life of Alexander the Great is of perennial interest, for
it holds in epitome the life of the world when the world was
young. Plutarch tells with quaint truthfulness what cannot
now be told without a smile of wondering incredulity.</p>

<p>Alexander spent the night before the battle of Arbela in
consultation with the diviner Aristander, and in sacrificing to the
god Fear. What does that mean? The conqueror of the world
would placate Fear; would render it favorable to him, adverse
to the enemy. Terror, recoil from death, panic-madness of a
multitude of men, rout, ruin&mdash;from <em>that</em> deliver my army, O
great god Fear; but let it come upon my enemy. Thus prayed
Alexander as his gaze rested upon the moving plain gleaming
with a million torch-lights where Darius, prepared for a night
attack, was reviewing his forces. And well might Alexander
so pray. Fear that blanches the lips and freezes the blood in
the heart, contagious Terror irresistible, dread recoil from
butchering death&mdash;these were, indeed, effects of causes proportionately
terrible. A million men were in the enemy’s ranks,
three hundred chariots armed with scythes; rivers were in the
rear, and beyond a hostile country.</p>

<p>“Alexander,” says Napoleon, “deserves the glory which he
has enjoyed for so many centuries and among all nations; but
what if he had been beaten at Arbela, having the Euphrates,
the Tigris, and the deserts in his rear, without any strong
places of refuge, nine hundred leagues from Macedonia!”</p>

<p>After the sacrifice to the god Fear, as Plutarch gravely assures
us, Alexander <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'seemed jubliant in'">seemed jubilant in</ins> spirit, and returning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his tent, made ready to take his rest. Parmenio, his oldest and
ablest general, sought him there and suggested that a night
attack be made, urging that their army would grow faint at
heart could they see as in broad daylight the countless hosts
arrayed against them. In conclusion Parmenio respectfully
said, “And if I were Alexander I would attack the Persians
tonight.”</p>

<p>To this Alexander ironically replied “And so would I if I
were Parmenio.” On further remonstrance being made Alexander
curtly replied, “I will not steal a victory.” At this
Parmenio withdrew and Alexander lay down to rest.</p>

<p>A profound and most refreshing sleep came to Alexander.
Morning dawned and it seemed proper to rouse the men to
breakfast and to preparation for battle, but Alexander still
slept. In the words of Plutarch: “But at last, time not giving
them leave to wait any longer, Parmenio went to his bedside and
called him twice or thrice by his name, till he waked him, and
then asked how it was possible, when he was to fight the most
important battle of all, he could sleep so soundly as if he were
already victorious. ‘And are we not so, indeed,’ replied Alexander
smiling, ‘since we are at last relieved from the trouble of
wandering in pursuit of Darius thro’ a wide and wasted country,
hoping in vain, that he would fight us?’ And not only
before the battle, but in the height of the danger, he showed
himself great, and manifested the self-possession of a just foresight
and confidence.”</p>

<p>Alexander’s full front battle line was not so long as Darius’
center. And this so seeming fatal arrangement yet turned out
to be most favorable for Alexander. For instead of attacking
the Persian center where Darius commanded in person and
where the ground in front had been smoothed and prepared for
the rush of the three hundred scythe-chariots, Alexander <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'attacked vigoriously'">attacked
vigorously</ins> the left wing, driving them in front of and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
towards the center. The onslaught of the Macedonian phalanx
was irresistible and the Persian army, dominated by the god
Fear, was in panic rout before Darius could get his unwieldy
forces full into action or send forth the chariots upon which he
so much relied.</p>

<p>Alexander pursued the fleeing enemy until urged back by
messengers from Parmenio saying his wing was surrounded by
the Persians. Alexander reluctantly returned and full victory
for the Macedonian army was soon proclaimed upon the field.</p>

<p>Darius, seeing that all was lost and that his chariot, wedged
in among dead bodies high as the shoulders of the horses, was
unable either to advance or to turn back, hastily leaped from his
seat and seizing a riderless mare, he galloped as best he could
over the bodies of the dying and the dead and thus escaped from
the battlefield.</p>

<p>The break in the friendship between Alexander and his ablest
general, Parmenio, began with the battle of Arbela. Was there
jealousy, cruel as the grave, in the heart of the older man as he
saw success after success crown the brow of the young commander?
Granicus, Issus, Arbela&mdash;Europe, Asia, Africa, the
world&mdash;had gone down successively under the Conqueror.
Jealously is incipient hate.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Human, Too Human.</span></h3>

<p>All that the literatures of the world hold treasured in amber;
all that life, the primal fount of literature, holds as its human
heritage&mdash;find fitting application to Alexander the Great. The
color scale&mdash;from white thro’ tints to standard, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
standard thro’ shades to black&mdash;of every emotion and passion of
the heart of man is fixed fadelessly upon the name and fame of
Alexander.</p>

<p>Yet how human and dearly human it all is! We understand
it today even as Callisthenes understood it, and as the age B. C.
and the early age and the middle age understood it. We haven’t
advanced even yet very far from the primitive. The heart that
in drunken rage slew Clitus his friend, and then mourned his
deed inconsolable in his tent for three days&mdash;is easily cognizable
today.</p>

<p>That quarrel between Alexander and his tried and true
Macedonians, with its subsequent reconciliation, has in it a ring
of the old young-world. For when Alexander returned to Susa
with his worn out troops, he at once sought out the thirty thousand
boys whom he had left there in training. Great was his delight
at the progress they had made in his absence; at their military
bearing, their ability to ride and hurl the javelin, and to
perform other adroit manœuvres. Alexander then thought to
reorganize his army and send home all the Macedonians who
were in any way disabled, or who, when urged to cross over the
Ganges, had begged to be taken back to their wives and children.
But the sturdy veterans were sorely offended at this proposal,
and breaking out into a rage, declared that they had been most
unjustly dealt with, and that every Macedonian would at once
abandon the army, and that, perhaps, with his pretty boys he
might be able to keep the world which their good swords had
won for him. To this Alexander responded in deep wrath that
it should be as they said. He at once dismissed from his service
all the Macedonians and filled their places with Persians.</p>

<p>Now when the Macedonians saw that it was done even as they
had said, the scales of jealous anger dropped from their eyes
and they were deeply repentant. So laying aside their arms, and
dressed only in short undergarments they sought suppliantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the tent of Alexander. But it opened not to their importunities.
For three days they stayed there neither eating nor drinking,
but sorely longing for the light of the countenance of Alexander,
for every man loved him. And at last the tent door opened and
Alexander came forth, and going affectionately among them he
sat down and wept; and they wept.</p>

<p>Then Alexander, thinking it wiser that the maimed should
embark in the waiting vessels, spoke to them most kindly, praising
their valor and declaring that their deeds should be known
throughout the world: saying also that he would write concerning
them to his mother Olympias and to the Governor of
Macedonia, giving orders that the first seats in the theatres
should be reserved for them and that they should therein be
crowned with chaplets of flowers. Moreover every soldier’s pay
should continue to him, and the pay due to the fallen should be
regularly sent to their wives and children. And thus was reconciliation
between Alexander and his Macedonians happily
effected.</p>

<p>How childish it all is&mdash;that jealous hate and the hasty reaction;
the humiliating importunities of barbaric love; the Conqueror
conquered and&mdash;in tears; the generous re-fusion of the
old warm feelings; the magnanimity of the Great; the joyous departure
of the honored veterans, their sitting in the seats of
honor crowned with a chaplet of flowers: childish? well, yes,
but we older children can understand and even dimly&mdash;remember.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Deity.</span></h3>

<p>Did Alexander believe himself descended from Jupiter Ammon?
No. On one occasion being wounded he said “This, my
friends, is real blood flowing not Ichor,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Such as immortal gods are wont to shed.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Yet if the reply of the gymnosophist be admitted as true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Alexander was not a mortal. The Gymnosophists, or wise men
of India, were entertained at the court of Alexander, and among
the questions proposed to them by the young lord of the world
was, how a man might become a god: to this the sage replied
“By doing that which was impossible for men to do.” The
deeds done by Alexander in his brief thirty-two years seem beyond
the merely human: and it is certain that he was honored
as a deity in the latter years of his life. He had his friend and
biographer, Callisthenes, tortured and put to death because he
had derisively laughed while the servile court prostrated before
the “present Deity”, and had refused to follow their example.</p>

<p>“Man, vain man dressed in a little brief authority does cut
such capers before high heaven as make the angels mourn.” The
awful punishments inflicted upon Thebes, Tyre, Gaza; the maniacal
madness that satiated itself in the life-blood of Clitus&mdash;a
warrior, comrade, and friend, a soldier who at Granicus had
thrust his own body between Alexander and the down-plunging
slaughtering sword and so receiving in his own flesh the blow,
had saved the life of the man who should later slay him; the
deadly ingratitude which could forget the lifelong services of
Parmenio, his father’s ablest general, his own boyhood’s adviser,
admirer, and friend, and, in a fit of jealous rage, condemn to
death Philotas, son of Parmenio, and Parmenio; the hate-exultation
which, triumphant at last, had the feet of Batis, late satrap
of Gaza and a bravely fallen foe, bored thro’ and thereby tied
to his chariot; then Alexander, descendant of Achilles, drove
three times thro’ the streets of Gaza, dragging his living victim&mdash;naked,
torn, bleeding, broken, dying&mdash;thro’ the town in which
so late he has reigned as Persian satrap: surely at capers such
as these well might the angels mourn.</p>

<p>Yet these atrocities are well nigh balanced by acts of heroism,
repentant generosity, benignity, magnanimity: and it is an open
question whether any other of the race of mortals, having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
world of his time absolutely in his own hands, would have acted
as wisely as Alexander.</p>

<p>The eunuch escaping from the Macedonian camp and bearing
to Darius the news of his wife Statira’s death, extolled the forbearance
and chivalrous courtesy of Alexander toward the Persian
captives and admiringly cried out “Alexander is as gentle
after victory as he is terrible on the field.” And Darius, so
late King of Persia, tallest and handsomest man of his time,
husband of Statira, most bewitchingly beautiful woman of Asia;
but now alas! an uncrowned king, loser of Arbela, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a fugutive, bereft'">a fugitive,
bereft</ins> of sons, daughters, wife&mdash;nevertheless on hearing of Alexander’s
generous conduct towards the royal captives exclaimed
in tears, “Ye gods of my family, and of my kingdom, if it be
possible, I beseech you to restore the declining affairs of Persia,
that I may leave them in as flourishing a condition as I found
them, and have it in my power to make a grateful return to
Alexander for the kindness which in my adversity he had shown
to those who are dearest to me. But if, indeed, the fatal time
be come, which is to give a period to the Persian monarchy, if
our ruin be a debt which must be paid to the divine jealousy,
and the vicissitude of things, then, I beseech you, grant that no
man but Alexander may sit upon the throne of Cyrus.” And
when slowly bleeding to death from wounds inflicted by his base
betrayer, Bessus, satrap of a province into which Darius had
fled for safety&mdash;the dying monarch begged of Polystratus, a
chance attendant, for a little water: and on receiving it he said
that it had become the last extremity of his ill fortune to receive
benefits and not be able to return them. “But Alexander,”
said he, “whose kindness to my mother, my wife and my children
I hope the gods will recompense, will doubtless thank you
for your humanity to me. Tell him, therefore, in token of my
acknowledgment, I give him this right hand,” with these words
he took hold of Polystratus’ hand and died.</p>

<p>The man who could inspire such sentiments of grateful admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into the heart of his dying enemy was more than
mortal.</p>

<p>Plutarch tells us that Alexander, coming up at that moment,
gazed with painful emotion upon the dead form of Darius.
And taking the cloak from off his own shoulders he covered
with it the prostrate form of his late foe, and gazing down upon
the fierce dead comely face&mdash;he wept.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Philosophies.</span></h3>

<p>All the philosophies of the sleepy East and their antitheses
of the aggressive West seem to have receptively influenced the
myriad-minded Alexander.</p>

<p>Pride, not vanity, but pride essentially one with the chords
of being, expressed itself in the words “And were I not Alexander
I would be Diogenes.” Either highest or lowest, all or
nothing. Earth as kingdom or&mdash;a tub; no compromise, no half
way, absolutely and unconditionally either one extreme or the
other: this seeming perversity in the makeup of many men of
genius has not been sufficiently considered; it is not psychologically
understood; there is something humanly attractive about
it; something young-world young and something old, old as the
heart of man. And this perverse pride was the common link
between Alexander and Diogenes, and by it each understood
the other: to the former, indeed, fate awarded the earth-kingdom
and to the latter&mdash;the tub; but these extremes were, by the common
link, essentially one.</p>

<p>The Gymnosophists, or wise men of India, whom Alexander
consulted, could not have deeply impressed the mind of the
pupil of Aristotle, for, as Plutarch tells us, he laughed at them
and sent them away with many presents.</p>

<p>Yet the sacrificial death of Calanus, one of these seers, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not fail to affect forcibly the susceptible mind of Alexander.
Jests, dreams, auspices, oracles, theories, sophisms, philosophies,
metaphysical speculations in general&mdash;well, these are agreeably
adjustable; maybe so maybe not so; and when looked at
too logically they can all scamper away and hide themselves
elusively in Symbolism: but death, death in flames, self-sought,
self-devised, self-suffered&mdash;that is real, that is awful.</p>

<p>On the day of his death and whilst erecting his funeral pile
Calanus talked cheerfully with the Macedonians and urged them
to drink deep and enjoy the passing hours. He commended
himself to Alexander, whom, he said, he doubted not but that
he should soon see again at Babylon. Then when the pyre was
finished, he set it on fire, sprinkled himself, and cutting off some
of his hair, threw it into the flame as a first-offering of the
sacrifice: he then mounted the pyre, lay down calmly and covered
his head in his robe. He moved not as the crackling flames
drew near, nor might any one note the least tremor of fear in
his limbs as the fire fed on them, nor did any sigh or moan escape
from his lips: tho’ what contortions of agony may have
twisted themselves on his face could not be known for his head
and shoulders were hid in his robe.</p>

<p>Alexander stood by and watched the scene. At first he
thought to interpose, but learning that such was the custom of
the country, and that the seer, by this sacrificial death, drew
to himself high honor and special veneration from the people,
he forbore. Alexander’s brow was clouded as he watched the
full-fed flames: in his mind re-echoed the threefold question of
the Indian seer: <em>Whence are we come; whereby do we live;
whither do we go?</em> Ah, whither! in his heart ten thousand recriminative
contradictory questionings seethed voiceless, answerless.
Alexander turned dejectedly away and retired within his
tent.</p>

<p>That night violent reaction from the depression of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
seized upon Alexander. He ordered that all his army should rest
and feast. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpe diem</i> was the dominating animus of the ensuing
debauch. In a delirium of drunken joy Alexander proposed
a drinking bout offering a crown to the victor. Promachus
drank twelve quarts of wine and to him was awarded the prize.
But Promachus did not live long to enjoy his reward, three days
after he died from the effects of the debauch as did forty others
who had taken part in the drinking bout at the great court feast.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a strong tendency in human nature to
rush from one extreme to the other. The best by corruption become
the worst; no one can fall so low as he who has been
highest. But from the lowest which has known the highest there
rush at times instantaneous recoil, re-ascent, re-attainment&mdash;momentary
tho’ it be&mdash;to the highest. Then when genius gilds
that lowest, that recoil, re-ascent, re-attainment&mdash;the thoughtless
world is thrilled, it listens anew, it understands.</p>

<p>Some of the chastest lyrics of the language have been written
in recoil from, in liberation and glad bird freedom from the
slough of sensuality.</p>

<p>The significant charm of Francis Thompson’s <cite>Hound of Heaven</cite>
lies in what it connotes rather than in what it tells. Soul-struggle
is enmeshed in the lines, and defeat is heard in alto
moan with every note of victory. It is the violent rebound to
the height gilded, perhaps goldened, by genius.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Feast.</span></h3>

<p>The ode <cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite> by Dryden is one of many contributions
to literature inspired by the Macedonian Madman.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Great genius is to madness near allied</p>
<p class="verse">And thin partitions do their bounds divide.”</p>
<p class="verse20">&mdash;<cite>Dryden.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps the taking of Persepolis and the mad orgy of triumph
there indulged in, mark the flood-tide of Alexander’s good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fortune and likewise the fateful turning and re-flow of the tide.
But what a tide!</p>

<p>Given the effects of generous wine; and the warrior, the military
genius, the poet-philosopher, the dreamer of dreams, the
world conqueror, the fair-haired favorite of Zeus, is, indeed, in
that wondrous triumph-hour&mdash;a deity. That sycophant court-adulation,
that lulling love, that music, that wine might well
“raise a mortal to the skies or draw an angel down.” O music,
elf of a lost paradise, we remember with you, we lament, we love,
we pity, we deplore, we&mdash;weep. With young-world Alexander
touched to tears by old Timotheus’ lyre, we too lament a bravely
fallen foe:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“He sang Darius great and good</p>
<p class="verse">By too severe a fate</p>
<p class="verse">Fallen, fallen, fallen,</p>
<p class="verse">Fallen from his high estate,</p>
<p class="verse">And weltering in his blood.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>We too deplore human ingratitude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Deserted in his utmost need</p>
<p class="verse">By one his former bounty fed&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">On the bare earth exposed he lies</p>
<p class="verse">With not a friend to close his dying eyes.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>We too muse mournfully perplexed o’er all this sorry scheme
of things and mingle our tears with those which thus perplexedly
flowed so long ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,</p>
<p class="verse">Revolving in his altered soul</p>
<p class="verse">The various turns of chance below;</p>
<p class="verse">And, now and then, a sigh he stole</p>
<p class="verse">And tears began to flow.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Lyre of old Timotheus, wizard violin, symphony concert&mdash;for
the hour at least, we are what you make us, and whither you
lead we follow. Sadness, remorseful sorrow-love, youth and
beauty caught coiled in icy death&mdash;are these, as Poe asserts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
essential elements of supreme beauty? Poe’s magically beautiful
<cite>Lenore</cite>, <cite>Raven</cite>, <cite>Ullalume</cite>, <cite>Annabel Lee</cite> confirm the poet-critic’s
dictum. Love in sorrow, beauty in death, mutability,
vicissitude are the dominant chords in music, in literature, and
in life.</p>

<p>But reaction follows depression, and violent activity succeeds
to passivity. And this the old musician knew who played
so well upon the all too humanly receptive heart of Alexander.
The wail of the Grecian ghosts “that in battle were
slain and unburied remain inglorious on the plain” call for
vengeance and point out the abodes of the Persian gods.</p>

<p>Thais leads the way, and Alexander, drunk with wine and
with the madness of music, follows whither she leads him; and
soon the temples of the gods, the palaces of the Persian kings,
the city Persepolis&mdash;are in crackling flame.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alexander is again Alexander. With shame of soul
he sees the ruin he has wrought and frantically strives to undo
what he has done. But too late; countermands clash with
commands, confusion feeds the flame, Persepolis falls.</p>

<p>Thus culminated the triumph-banquet held in honor of Alexander’s
conquest of Asia and immortally sung into song by
John Dryden in one of the best odes of the English language,
<cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hellenism.</span></h3>

<p>Alexander died in a comparatively short time after the battle
of Arbela and his world empire fell to pieces. What, then,
was the permanent good or decisive effect of his conquests?
To this question historians reply that the Hellenization of the
Orient with subsequent spread of Greek culture among the
Arabian Saracens, thence as vital principle re-animating the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Rennaissance'">Renaissance</ins>&mdash;was the result of Alexander’s conquest of Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>More than seventy Greek colonies were established along the
route of the Conqueror. These continued to flourish long after
the far seeing mind that planned them had ceased to foresee
and plan. Vigorous Hellenism was easily dominant over sleepy
Orientalism. And thus was bloodlessly won thro’ the slow
centuries, the great victory of freedom, civilization, culture, art,
science, philosophy&mdash;Hellenism. From Arbela (B. C. 331) to
the sixteenth century <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Rennaissance'">Renaissance</ins> is a conquering span that
might well delight the gaze of the young warrior who once
wept because there were no more worlds for him to conquer.
As Napoleon’s crucial defeat was not at Waterloo but in
Moscow; as the British Revolutionary forces lost the colonies not
at Yorktown but at Saratoga; as Carthage of old went down
under world-conquering Rome not at Zama, but at the Metaurus;
so the incipient death blow to Alexander was inflicted not in
Babylon but at the banks of the Ganges. When his army refused
to follow him any farther; when his brave Macedonians
wept for their far away homes and begged to be taken back to
their wives and children; when his best friends and admirers
saw in the wide rolling Ganges and the enemy bristling the opposite
bank, obstacles insuperable even to Alexander; when at
last the Conqueror turned away unconquering, turned back,
yielded&mdash;then came the fierce chagrin-humiliation, the mad beginning
of the end. The world marks only the collapse-crash,
but deeper insight sees sympathetically the fatal bend or twist
or crack or break having in it inevitably the tragic collapse-crash.</p>

<p>The death of Alexander has been variously described. Some
say he died of poison; others, of the exceeding coldness of the
waters of the river in which he bathed; others, that his death is
directly attributable to the excesses, the mad orgies of sensual
indulgence into which he plunged himself as result of his
chagrin at turning back from the Ganges, and of his wild grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
at the untimely death of Hephaeston his favorite and friend.
Doubtless the subjectivities of the various biographers have obtruded
themselves over the objective reality and the simple
truth will never be known. Alexander died at Babylon, 323
B. C., aged thirty-two.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></a><br /><br />

<span class="fs130">ZAMA</span></h2>


<p>Had the battle of Zama been won by the Carthaginians and
lost by the Romans, then Semitic influence rather than Aryan,
would have moulded the civilization of Europe. These two
mutually antagonistic races have grappled together in mortal
combat at Zama, Tours, Jerusalem and, influentially, at Belgrade,
Lepanto, Constantinople, Adrianople&mdash;and the end is not
yet. Will there ever be full amity between these races?</p>

<p>But Rome won at Zama. And as Roman historians gravely
assure us that it was better for all subsequent civilization that
Rome should win, why we gratefully acquiesce; feeling, indeed,
dully content that fate should, at all past times and crises, have
shown herself as wisely beneficent to the winning cause as she is
today. But however superior Rome may have been to Carthage,
and however Roman valor, Roman dogged endurance, Roman integrity,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romana Fides</i>) may have surpassed Carthaginian&mdash;yet
Hannibal, favorite of Baal, towered mountain-high over all
Romans of his day, and for a time, even over all Rome.</p>

<p>Hannibal’s personality thrills thro’ the centuries. The school-boy
with the good wonder-flush of admiration at the revealing
vistas of the past, understands Hannibal. That eternal enmity
to Rome in the son of Hamilcar; that youthful vow at the altar
of Baal and its life and death fulfilment; that Herculean crossing
of the Alps; Ticino, Trebia, Thrasymenus, Cannæ&mdash;Capua;
Metaurus, Zama: exile, suicide&mdash;why the school-boy understands
it all: and Hannibal, hunted victim of the past, is victor of the
passing hour. Glamour of the historic page, generous youth,
poets in prose, dreamers of dreams&mdash;and the Smoky City classroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is all aglow with white-light from the Alps as Hannibal
crosses; with red light from the bloody waters of Lake Thrasymenus;
with gold-glow from the rings severed from the cold dead
hands of Roman knights at dread Cannæ; with mocking death-light
as Hannibal defiantly dies!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Capua.</span></h3>

<p>And after the great victory at Cannæ Hannibal led his troops
into winter quarters at Capua. Here his soldiers, relaxed from
the severe discipline of war and wildly delighting in the genial
climate of southern Italy, gave themselves up unrestrainedly to
luxuries and pleasures. And just here at Capua, in the midst
of those luxuries and pleasures, lay potentially the defeat at
Zama.</p>

<p>For the Romans, gaining courage from despair, grimly faced
the fatal losses of Cannæ, and never were the Roman people
more royally Roman than when they voted thanks to the consul,
Terrentius Varro the runaway loser of Cannæ,&mdash;“because he
had not despaired concerning the Republic” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod de republica
non desperasset</i>). Every day spent by Hannibal and his army

<h3><span class="smcap">Defeat.</span></h3>

<p>The Roman senate determined to carry the war into the
enemy’s country hoping that thereby Carthage would be constrained
to summon Hannibal and his army from Rome in order
to defend the Carthaginian capital. Nor was this hope vain.
Hannibal’s eight years’ success in Italy was negatived by this
call from Carthage and his reluctant compliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Rome’s ablest general, Scipio, with a well equipped army
awaited Hannibal on his disheartened return into Africa. They
met at Zama.</p>

<p>History or story relates that a personal interview between
Scipio and Hannibal took place before the battle. Each stood in
awe and admiration of the other: each felt mutually the charm
of bravery, integrity, excellence; as men they were friends, as
leaders of hostile armies, they were enemies. The interview
proved futile. After a proudly lingering farewell they parted
with dignity; and riding back to their respective armies prepared
for immediate battle.</p>

<p>When the fight was fiercest and success seemed to favor the
Carthaginians, suddenly the sun ceased to shine and darkness
enveloped the contending hosts. It was an eclipse of the sun for
which the Romans were, in great measure, prepared; the
Carthaginians, wholly unprepared. Panic fear and superstitious
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'terror siezed'">terror seized</ins> upon Hannibal’s veterans; they who had crossed
the Alps, and stood knee deep in blood at Lake Trasymene and
at Cannæ, yet quailed in this midday darkness.</p>

<p>With the slow and ghastly return of the light of the sun,
Rome’s bull-dogs were again ferociously at slaughter; but the
Semitic heart had been smitten with awe of the unknown God;
he would pray, not fight; he would fall prone in adoration of
the awful Deity of darkness and of light. In vain did Hannibal
strive to rouse his terror-stricken legions, in vain did he himself
perform prodigies of valor: the hour of conquering Rome had
come and on her way to world-conquest lay Zama. The Juggernaut
of destiny rolled on, and Zama-Carthage fell to rise no
more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">And After.</span></h3>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Hannibal was only forty-five when he lost Zama. That flame
of hatred toward Rome, kindled at the altar of Baal when he
was a boy of only nine years, still raged within him inextinguishably.
He had lost his right eye in the Roman campaign. His
brave brothers, Mago, hero of Trebia, and Hasdrubal, hero of
Metaurus, had fallen in battle. The second Punic War, the
war of Rome against Hannibal, or rather of Hannibal against
Rome, had after phenomenal successes, ended in the disastrous
defeat at Zama and in the most humiliating conditions of peace
imposed upon Carthage by world-conquering Rome. All, indeed,
seemed lost except a little life; yet in this dull defeat-peace,
this wearily sullen after-storm, the old hate fires insatiably
raged.</p>

<p>Hannibal, unsupported and unappreciated by his own country,
passed over into Asia. He wandered from Asiatic court to
court ever striving to arouse enmity towards Rome or to incite
the nations to battle against her. Rome steadily pursued her
inveterate foe. From court to court he passed, and from country
to country passed too, the paid assassins whose sole object
in life was to bring Hannibal dead or alive to Rome.</p>

<p>And at the court of Prusias, king of Bythinia, Hannibal was
at last hopelessly trapped. Hatefully grinning faces glared
in upon him from corridors, doors, windows: Rome had won.</p>

<p>Hannibal’s presence of mind and proud dignity did not desert
him even in that crucial hour, even when he toyed with
death. Whilst adjusting his military robes in full presence
of the leering faces at corridors, doors, and windows, he took
from his finger a ring whose hollow setting contained a most
potent poison. This he drank. And before any one of that self-gratulating
victor-gang realized what was taking place, Hannibal
fell forward dead.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church condemns suicide. The divine command
<em>Thou shalt not kill</em> has as its complete predicate <em>either thyself or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
another</em>. No man can escape from God. Death only shifts the
scene.</p>

<p>Stoicism advocated suicide; and many philosophies of the past
taught that a man ought not to outlive honor.</p>

<p>When one considers not only the chagrin and humiliations
and mental agonies, but also the rank physical tortures inflicted
upon the vanquished in times past, the full meaning of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vae
Victis</i> (Woe to the vanquished!) is brought forcibly to the mind.
Those were wild-beast times and the jungle-fights are ferocious.
Plutarch speaking of the proscription list at the close of the
civil war between Cæsar and Anthony says: “The terms of
their mutual concessions were these: that Cæsar should desert
Cicero, Lepidus his brother Paulus, and Anthony, Lucius
Cæsar, his uncle by his mother’s side. Thus they let their anger
and fury take from them the sense of humanity, and demonstrated
that no beast is more savage than man, when possessed
with power answerable to his rage.” And we read in Marlowe’s
“Tamburlaine” that this mighty despot, conqueror of many
Asiatic kings, made use of these one time monarchs to draw him
in his chariot: and that bridled and with bits in their mouths
they fumed forward under the swishing wire-lash, while galling
insults goaded on their pangs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse6">“Forward, ye jades!</p>

<p>Whether this be only “Marlowe’s mighty line”, or whether
it be the somewhat fantastic presentation of a dread reality&mdash;need
not be known. The thoughtful student of history knows
only too well just where to turn for human jungle-scenes. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
there are many. From Assyrian cruelty boasting of pyramids

to Balkan-Turkish atrocities and Mexican murders the
forest-way is long and dark and dreary. We hope light will
yet shine upon this way. We dream that the black hags of
war and of demon cruelty will not dare disport their hideousness
in the future white-light. We would suspend judgment
as to the past; we would not condemn Hannibal; we would play
on the one-string lyre of hope&mdash;forlorn tho’ it be as Watts’
allegorical “Hope”&mdash;and we would wait kindly content with

<span class="fs130">TEUTOBERGER WALD</span></h2>


<p>In Germany, in the modern principality of the Lippe, may
still be seen traces of the historic struggle between the Roman
legions under Varus and the Germanic barbarians led by Arminius.
The names “das Winnefeld” (the field of victory), “die
Knochenbahn” (the bone-lane), “die Knochenleke” (the bone-brook),
“der Mordkessel” (the kettle of slaughter), which still
characterize various places in the gloomy Teutoberger Wald, are
in themselves reminders of scenes of horror which were once
dread realities; while scattered here and there may still be seen
traces of the Roman camp&mdash;unmistakable evidence of the one
time presence of the Roman eagles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Trapped.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps all is fair in war, and the end justifies the means,
and the eleventh commandment “Do to the enemy what he’d
like to do to you”, being altogether heartless and godless is
peculiarly applicable to war: nevertheless the victory won by
treachery never sounds so clarionly joyous adown the ages as
the victory following a fair fight; and the deadly defeat that
came by treachery has in it a pathos that redeems defeat from
disgrace. Time is just.</p>

<p>When Varus started out at the head of his legions to quell,
as he thought, an insurrection of a few unimportant tribes
scattered along the Weser and the Ems rivers, Germany seemed
comparatively at peace; and Arminius, the most dreaded war-lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the barbarians, seemed to have been won over by the
blandishments of the Roman camp.</p>

<p>It was a gala day for the troops as with ample supplies,
generous baggage-wagons, plenty of camp followers, jesters,
entertainers, they turned away from the frontier and plunged
into the Black Forest. There was nothing to indicate that concerted
action on the part of the Germans was the cause of that
far distant uprising against Roman authority, and that within
their ranks were half-Romanized barbarians who would desert
at a given signal and use their arms against their present comrades;
above all, that Arminius had secretly instigated a general
uprising and that the Black Forests were blackly alive with the
foe.</p>

<p>On went the Roman troops following their treacherous guides
who purposely led them into the dense marshy depths of the
woods; and when thus lost and entangled, their cavalry unable
to advance, and while all the troops were called upon to construct
a rude causeway over which the horses might proceed&mdash;suddenly
from the gloom encompassing them on all sides came
deadly arrows, missiles, javelins hurled by an unseen foe.</p>

<p>Varus seems to have been unable to realize that he was the
victim of a stratagem. His best men, officers and soldiers, were
falling around him; his cavalry slipping in slimy blood lay
floundering on the way; his light-armed auxiliaries, composed in
great part of brawny German youth, were slinking away and
becoming strangely one with the forces whence came the arrows,
missiles, javelins. Still Varus urged on the work on the
causeway, and still veterans advanced to the work as veterans
fell and at last the gloomy march resumed.</p>

<p>The attack seemed over and Varus thought some isolated tribe
of barbarians had taken advantage of their hour of disability
to harass them on the march. On reaching a declivity of the
woody plain Varus drew up his forces as best he could in battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
line and thus awaited the coming of the foe. But Arminius was
not prepared to meet the Romans in battle; his rude warriors
were no match for the trained Roman soldiers fully protected
by helmet, cuirass, greaves, and shield. There could have been
but one result to such an encounter&mdash;victory for the Romans,
defeat for the cause of liberty and native land.</p>

<p>Arminius held in leash his blood-hounds all thro’ the night.
The Romans halted on the slope and, perceiving no enemy near,
pitched their camp with true Roman precision and then slept
long and well the heavy sleep of worn out nature that last night
of mortal life.</p>

<p>At early dawn, while the Roman camp yet lay moveless, undreaming
of the savage blood-hounds around or the deadly ambush
ahead,&mdash;Arminius despatched men to the farther end of
the defile with orders to fell trees and erect an impassable barricade.
He then sent troops to different points of advantage
on either side of the defile thro’ which the fated army would
advance; he gave instructions as to concerted action at the sound
of the agreed-upon signal, and thus awaited the coming of morn
and the renewed activities of the Roman camp.</p>

<p>There is something sternly terrible in the human heart which
can thus joyfully contemplate the destruction of thousands
upon thousands of one’s fellow mortals. And yet, in this case,
these Roman soldiers were the concrete embodiment of a cause
which would enslave Arminius’ native land, intrude deadly
enervation into the integrity of a German home; and more&mdash;much
more: Rome had deeply wronged Arminius, lover of liberty,
lover of native land; but even more deeply had she
wronged Arminius, the lover, and the man. His wife, Thusnelda,
was held a captive in Rome and his child, a fair haired boy of
only five years, had been made to grace a Roman triumph.
Rivers of blood could not wash away such seared yet burning
memories from the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>With fierce exultation did Arminius watch the waking of the
camp, the taking up of pickets, formation of line, and the slow
winding motion towards the way, the fatal way, he had foreseen
they must go. Had Varus even then become suspicious of
concerted treachery, he would have hastened back, would have
plunged into the heart of the unknown wood, would have remained
in camp, would have done anything under the sun rather
than advance right into that narrow densely wooded way ambushed
at every vantage point on both sides and shut in at the
farther end by that barricade high as the tops of the trees.
But he looked and knew not; Arminius saw and knew and
exulted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Der Mordkessel.</span></h3>

<p>Fate is always on the winning side. As day advanced and
the troops were all now fairly within the ravine, the heavens
opened in streams of torrential rain. The Black Forest seemed
to groan with impending doom: old Thor and Odin seemed fighting
for their altars in the Druid wood, and Roman Jove was
no match for this grim Teutonic Thor.</p>

<p>Arminius watched from the height; and just as the vanguard
rounded the curve at the summit of which rose the barricade of
trees, the signal for general assault all along the line arose clear
and decisive from the height.</p>

<p>The slaughter was appalling. The bulk of the infantry,
fourteen thousand men, were slain; while the cavalry which at
first had numbered about eighteen hundred horsemen, partly
Romans partly provincial, made here its last dread stand against
the foe and&mdash;lost.</p>

<p>Numonius Vola, a Roman cavalry officer, seeing the utter
uselessness of the attempt to continue the unfair strife, made a
bold dash for deliverance. At the head of a small force, he turned
away from the floundering mass of horses and men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
plunged into the unknown forest. He was, however, soon surrounded
by the Germans, and he and his soldiers were cut to
pieces.</p>

<p>A brave band of Romans, last of that death-devoted multitude
of men, gained a point of vantage on a hill slope and arranging
themselves in a solid circle presented to the foe an almost impenetrable
line of glittering points of spears. The Germans,
tho’ outnumbering them a hundred to one, yet quailed before
that steely welcome. Perhaps, too, being themselves brave men,
they were in awe and admiration of that heroic despair; perhaps,
being perfectly sure of their prey, they were loth to
break the savage satisfaction of gloating upon its desperation;
perhaps no Arnold Winkelreid opportunely came forth to offer
himself in sacrifice upon those outstretched points and so wedge
open the way; perhaps, and O most dread truth-perhaps!
those wild children of the Druid wood saw safely entrenched behind
that helpless steel&mdash;worthy victims for Odin. And thus the
night passed&mdash;that awful last night upon earth for the last of
the legions of Varus.</p>

<p>There is an open space on the flat top of an overhanging
rock, darkly terrible even today and still the favorite haunt of
century old oaks: and this place tradition points out as the spot
upon which human sacrifices were of old offered to Thor and
to Odin. And thither the blue eyed barbarians dragged those
Roman soldiers, bravest of the brave, who had stood entrenched
behind their helpless steel until exhaustion overcame them and
who at last overpowered by sheer force of numbers, had been
taken alive by the implacable foe and dragged to the altar of
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Strange indeed is that delusion, so often inextricably assimilable
with religious fanaticism, wherein a man makes himself
believe that he honors or placates Deity by immolating thereto
his own enemy! Truly the human-heart god is the deification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of its own desires. And that God-man upon the Cross who is
essentially the everlasting antithesis of the desires of the human
heart is not of man. We can understand Jove and Juno and
Mars and Venus and even Odin and Thor&mdash;they are ourselves
only more so: not so the Christ crucified on Calvary.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Effects.</span></h3>

<p>Fifteen thousand eight hundred men are estimated to have
formed the army lost in the Teutoberger Wald. This irreparable
loss gave to the heart of Cæsar Augustus its pathetic cry
enduring even to the day of death, “Varus, Varus, give back my
legions, Varus!”</p>

<p>Suetonius tells us that at the news of the Black Forest disaster,
Augustus, in bitter grief, beat his head against the wall
crying incessantly and inconsolably, “Bring back my legions,
Varus”: and that after many years had passed and even to the
day of his death he lamented the loss as irreparable. Not,
indeed, because so many men had fallen; Rome was prodigal of
human life; but because his prophetic eye saw in this defeat the
beginning of the end of Roman supremacy; the change of policy
from aggressive to defensive; the fatal turning of a tide which
should roll down upon southern Europe in inundations of desolation.</p>

<p>Many other ancient writers attest the seriousness of this defeat
to Rome and corroborate <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'what Seutonius says'">what Suetonius says</ins> as to its
effect upon Augustus. Dion Cassius says, “Then Augustus,
when he heard the calamity of Varus, rent his garment, and was
in great affliction for the troops he had lost, and for terror
respecting the Germans and the Gauls. And his chief alarm
was, that he expected them to push on against Italy and Rome;
and there were no Roman youth fit for military duty that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
worth speaking of, and the allied populations that were at all
serviceable had been wasted away.”</p>

<p>Florus also expresses its effects: “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hac clade factum est ut
imperium quod in litore oceani non steterat, in ripa Rheni
fluminis staret</i>.” (The result of this disaster was that the empire
which had not been content that it be bounded by the
shore of ocean was forced to accept as its boundary the River
Rhine).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arminius.</span></h3>

<p>There was an attempt made many years ago to erect a statue
to the memory of Arminius. The site chosen for this imposing
monument was, of course, the Teutoberger Wald. It was
suggested that contributions be received only from the English
and German nations and that the statue should stand as a
memorial of the common ancestry and heritage of the German-English
races.</p>

<p>Arminius is indeed more truly an English national hero than
was Caractacus, if the Saxon genealogy be properly traced.</p>

<p>However, the project fell through. England and Germany
are not yet amicably one under the tutelage of a far off German
war-lord: and no colossal statue of Arminius&mdash;successful
strategist and wholesale slaughterer&mdash;rises today in gloomy
Teutoberger Wald from out the dark depths of Der Mordkessel.</p>

<span class="fs130">ADRIANOPLE</span></h2>


<p>Among the struggles of the past which seem decisively to
have subverted the old order of things and ushered in the new,
is the battle of Adrianople. There Valens, Emperor of Rome,
was killed in battle with the Goths; and the proud Roman army
hitherto deemed invincible, almost invulnerable, was defeated
and destroyed.</p>

<p>How the wild-eyed children of the North must have gazed
with astonishment upon one another as they stood victors on
that field! They had not dared to hope that a Roman army would
go down under their undisciplined assault; and that an Emperor
of Rome should lie dead upon the battlefield was far beyond
their wildest dream. Doubtless they felt within them that
first awakening of brutal youth-strength: race-childhood was
gone; race-manhood not yet come. And enervated old Rome;
cultured, wily, effetely civilized Romans lay at the feet of these
youthful, battle-flushed barbarians: and history yet hears the
cries that arose as those feet advanced ruthlessly trampling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rivers.</span></h3>

<p>If rivers could write history&mdash;what would the Nile tell us, the
Tigris-Euphrates, the Granicus-Issus, the Metaurus, the Aufidus,
the Tiber, the Danube, the Moskva, the Maritza?</p>

<p>Mysterious Nile&mdash;with sources for ages unknown; with inundations
death-dealing, life-giving; with crocodiles and alligators
and implacable river God: with Theban Karnak-Luxor and the
Necropolis; with Memphis and the Pyramids and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Sphinx; with dynastic silences perturbed by a few great names&mdash;Menes,
Cheops, Rameses; with the barge of Cleopatra wafted
by scent-sick breezes to a waiting Anthony; with cosmopolitan
bad, sad, modern Memphis-Cairo.</p>

<p>Tigris-Euphrates valley&mdash;cradle of the human race! home of
the Accadians, a pre-historic people that had passed away and
whose language had become a dead classic tongue when Nineveh
and Babylon were young. Who were the Accadians? Who were
the Etruscans? The Euphrates and the Tiber will not tell.</p>

<p>Hanging Gardens of Babylon&mdash;world-wonder: Babylon as
described by Herodotus&mdash;city of blood and beauty and winged
power: city surfeited with the slaughter of Assyrian Nineveh:
city of the great temple of Bel: city of palaces guarded by majestic
colossi&mdash;Sphinxes, winged lions, man-head bulls; city of
gold and precious stones and ivory edifices and streets of burnished
brass: city of the fatal Euphrates, of Baltshazzar’s banquet
and the dread hand-writing upon the wall: city of a destruction
so tremendous, so terrible that the lamentation thereof,
caught vibrantly in Biblical amber, rings on and ever on
adown the ages, “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“They say the Lion and the Lizard keep</p>

</div></div>

<p>And the site of Babylon, that mighty Paris of the past, is not
now authoritatively known. Does the river know; does it remember
the glory and the horror-night and the gloom? Is the
sad sighing of rivers caused by the sorrows they see as they
flow? And is the eternal moan of ocean the aggregate of the
throbs of woe that the rivers have felt as they flow? Does
nature know of mortal woe, does she, indeed, lament with
Moschus the death of pastoral Bion, with Shelley, the untimely
departure of Keats, our “Adonais”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Fact or fancy, suggestive silence or assertive sound, poet-dream
or cynic-certainty&mdash;which draws nearer to truth? which
shall prevail?</p>

<p>Granicus-Issus&mdash;bloody outlets of the wounds of the world
when Macedonian Alexander made Europe and Asia bleed!</p>

<p>Was Alexander the Great great? Moralize as we may; shudder
at the grim bloody outlets of a wounded world; wonder at
the mad folly of the masses who, at the caprice of a magnetic
madman, wildly slay and submit to be slain; see clearly, in the
cut and statuary past, the dolt unreason of it all, the uselessness,
the Pelion-Ossa horror: yet honestly recognize that deep down
in the perverse human heart there lurks loving admiration for&mdash;Alexander
the Great. Rameses, Cyrus, Alexander, Hannibal,
Cæsar, Napoleon&mdash;we cannot dissociate these men from their
deeds; how then can we disapprove their deeds and approve
these men? Why is it that a Shelley, Byron, De Musset,
Swinburne, Omar&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>&mdash;enthrall us by the charm of
their written words, even tho’ we disagree with them in their
tenets, their philosophy of life, their conclusions: and we censure
and condemn their private lives! Can men, as Catullus
sings to Lesbia, both “adore and scorn” the same object at the
same time? There are many replies to these questions, but no
satisfactory answer. Psychologists, take note.</p>

<p>The military hero, the “chief who in triumph advances”,
the Warrior Bold, the idols of history will continue to glimmer
secure in cob-web fascination even when armaments shall have
been banished from off the face of the earth and wars shall be
remembered only as the myths of days that are no more. We
forgive Granicus-Issus-Arbela for the sake of Alexander the
Great.</p>

<p>And the conqueror of the world died, aged thirty-two, in
Babylon. This cognizant old city and Accadian Euphrates were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
too wearily wise to wonder two thousand years ago. They had
seen the rise and fall of many monarchs: and one more, this boy-wonder
from the West, could arouse no throb of pitying surprise
from scenes that dully remembered dead and gone
dynasties. Why, death was old when Accadia was young ten
thousand years ago; lament this stripling? No. And thus
went out the conquered Conqueror of the world.</p>

<p>The little stream Metaurus witnessed perhaps the most momentous
battle of history. Yet no magic name shines forth
from that strife either as victor or vanquished. Nero, the Roman
consul, victor; and Hasdrubal, brother of Hannibal, vanquished;
are not the names of favorites of fame. As Byron
says, of a thousand students hearing the name <em>Nero</em> nine hundred
and ninety-nine recall the last Julian Emperor of Rome,
and one laboriously remembers the hero of Metaurus. And yet
were historians endowed with Platonic vision whereby the great
is perceived in the small, doubtless the bloody conflict by the
stream would be seen pivotal of history.</p>

<p>O hopes and fears and blasted dreams of so gigantic scale,
played on a stage of Alpine eminence, no wonder you stand
spectacular thro’ the ages!</p>

<p>“Alas, I shall not now send to Carthage proud bearers of good
news,” said Hannibal, as he mournfully gazed at the severed
head of his brother, hurled insolently into his camp, even as
with impatient hope he awaited news of that brother’s coming
and dreamed the dream of their successfully united forces, attack
on Rome, victory, and the dispatch of proud messengers
to Carthage. With prophetic gaze did the hero of Cannæ see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in that bloodily dead face the negation of his eight years’ victory
in Italy, his recall to Carthage, his defeat at Zama, his
exile and bitter death, and the onward stride of world-conquering
Rome over the ashes of Carthage.</p>

<p>“Varus, Varus, give back my legions, Varus”&mdash;that cry of
Cæsar Augustus, Ruler of Rome, Mistress of the World, was the
first wild note of a chorus of woe that arose in full diapason
when Valens fell in the battle of Adrianople. From the victory
of Arminius over the Roman troops under Quintilius
Varus in the Black Forest of Germany (A. D. 9) to the decisive
victory of the combined Gothic tribes over the veteran Roman
army under Valens near the capital of the Empire, the sympathetic
student of history may hear ever that losing cry of the
Emperor-seer, “Give back my legions, Varus.”</p>

<p>Legend relates that on the Roman northern frontier there
stood a colossal statue of Victory; it looked toward the North,
and with outstretched hand pointing to the Teutoberger Wald,
seemed to urge on to combat and victory: but the night following
the massacre of the Roman troops in the Black Forest,
and the consequent suicide of Varus, this statue did, of its own
accord, turn round and face the South, and with outstretched
hand pointing Romeward, seemed to urge on to combat and
victory the wild-eyed children of the North. Thus did the Goddess
of Victory forsake Rome.</p>

<p>The Moskva river is yet memory-lit with the fires of burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Moscow; and its murmuring ever yet faintly echoes the toll,
toll, toll of the Kremlin bell. Three days and three nights of
conflagration&mdash;and then the charred and crumbling stillness!
Snow on the hills and on the plains; white, peaceful snow healing
the wounds of Borodino, blanketing uncouth forms, hiding
the horror; but within the fated city, no snow, nothing white,
nothing peaceful; gaunt icicle-blackness o’er huge, prostrate
Pan-Slavism.</p>

<p>Yet surely cognizant old Moscow, secure in ruins, sighed, too,
o’er the gay and gallant Frenchmen caught fatefully in the
trap of desolation. Perhaps, too, the compensating lamentation
of distant Berezina mingled genially with the murmuring
Moskva.</p>

<p>Little Nap Bonaparte met his Waterloo in Moscow: history
to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“The soldiers fight and the kings are called heroes,” says
the Talmud. Of all that nameless host of ardent, life-loving men
who entered Moscow, stood aghast amid the ruins, started back
on that awful across-Continent retreat&mdash;the world knows only
Napoleon, history poses Napoleon, Meissonier paints Napoleon,
Byron apostrophizes Napoleon, Emerson eulogizes Napoleon,
Rachmaninoff plays Napoleon, and the hero-lover loves Napoleon.
Why? Is there any answer to ten thousand Whys perched
prominently and grinning insolently in this mad play-house of
the Planets? None.</p>

<p>The Maritza river, at one time called the Orestes river, is
formed by the confluence of two unimportant streams. Adrianople
is favorably situated, and ranks next to Constantinople in
natural advantages.</p>

<p>Orestes, son of Agamemnon, built the city and gave his name
both to the city and the principal river. Emperor Hadrian
changed the name to Hadrianopolis (Hadrian’s city), thence our
modernized Adrianople. One almost regrets that the name of
the restless Orestes did not continue appropriately to designate
the city of so varying fortunes and vivid vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Adrianople was the Turkish capital for nearly a hundred
years; it was abandoned in 1453 when Constantinople came into
Turkish control. The ruins of the palaces of the Sultans yet
grace the ancient capital.</p>

<p>Adrianople is the faithful Moslem city of forty mosques.
The mosque Selim II. is a close rival to Santa Sofia.</p>

<p>Greek and Macedonian, Roman and Byzantine, Christian and
Moslem, Turk and Bulgarian, influences have in turn dominated
the city of three rivers; each re-baptizing it with blood: and
the end is not yet.</p>

<p>In 1713, Charles XII. of Sweden was a guest in the castle of
Tumurtish. Little then did the valiant Madman of the North
dream how ignominiously his own meteoric career would close:
little did he see himself as fixed in fame, not by his combats
and victories, not even by his gallant defeat at Pultowa,
but by being the inspiration in the moralizing mind of Dr.
Samuel Johnson of the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“He left a name&mdash;at which the world grew pale&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">To point a moral or adorn a tale.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Vanity of Human Wishes is indeed exemplified not only
in Charles XII. of Sweden, but also in many other favorites of
fortune: not one of whom, perhaps, but would add to or alter his
own peculiar setting in fame&mdash;if perchance he should be able
to recognize himself at all in the historic figure masquerading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
under his name. How seldom does it chance that the world
honors a man for what that man feels to be his best title to
honor?</p>

<p>Would Julius Cæsar, red-hand conqueror of Gaul, know himself
as the Shakespearean hero? And Nero, Louis XI., Wallenstein,
Henry VIII., Roderick Borgia&mdash;would they claim even
passing acquaintance with themselves as fame has fixed them?
If these men took any of their fighting qualities with them into
the Spirit Land, there must have been some flamy duelling when
they met their respective biographers.</p>

<p>And so the blood of battle bathed Adrianople one thousand
five hundred and thirty-five years ago and&mdash;last year (1913).
And we talk learnedly about the defeat and death of
the Roman Emperor Valens, and of the effect of that victory
upon our respected barbarian ancestors with consequent doings
of destiny, etc., etc.&mdash;because we <em>don’t know</em>: and we say little
about the Servian-Bulgarian-Turkish capture of Adrianople last
year, because it is too near and&mdash;<em>we know</em>. Then, too, who can
poetize or moralize or even sentimentally scribble over the yet
hideously bleeding wounds of war? When they are healed, when
the moaning is still, the mangled forms moveless, the cripples on
crutches gone, the lamentations silenced, the last-lingering heartache
soothed in Death&mdash;why, then, perhaps; but not now. Battle
in the real is a human butchering: and there is no other delusion
under the sun more diabolically sardonic than that which
makes animal savagery seem patriotism and the red-hand
slaughter-man a hero. From the Homeric Hector-Achilles, deliver
the world, O Lord.</p>

<p>Strange, indeed, is the contrariety between the real of War
and the ideal, the far away hero and the near Huerta, the blood
spilled and stilled and the bright life-blood spilling, the sorrow
silenced and the agonized cries that arise, the battle of Adrianople,
378 A. D., and the siege and capture and re-capture of
Adrianople (1912-1913).</p>

<span class="fs130">CHALONS</span></h2>


<p>If, in the battle of Chalons, Attila and his Huns had been
victorious over the combined forces of the semi-Christianized
Visigoths under Theoderic and the Romans under Ætius&mdash;then
Hungvari influence rather than Teutonic would have dominantly
determined the progress of the civilized world.</p>

<p>Rome had fallen: effete in her withered hand lay the rod of
empire: and swarming about her, now quarrelling among themselves
and with her, now fraternizing, but always more or less
in awe of her prostrate majesty were her barbarous children&mdash;Franks,
Burgundians, Alans, Lombards, Gauls, Alemanni,
Visigoths, and Ostrogoths. These had known Rome in the hour
of her pride and power; they revered the Rome that was for
the sake of the Rome that had been; they had imbibed something
of her culture, her military discipline, her laws, her religion.
Semi-civilized, semi-Christianized, with the bold Teutonic virtues
yet pristine from the Black Forests of Germany,&mdash;they were
the possible material of an excellence surpassing that of Rome,
even when Rome could boast of excellence.</p>

<p>But about 450 A. D. hordes, innumerable hordes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velut unda
supervenit undam</i> (even as wave upon wave) of hideously ugly,
lithe, little, wiry, imp-like men poured into Europe from the
Asiatic lands north of the Black Sea. By their numbers, their
lightning-like rapidity, their uncanny appearance, and their
brute ferocity, they quickly swept the countries before them,
put to flight the Alans, the Ostrogoths, and other tribes dwelling
along the course of the Danube, and finally under their terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
leader Atzel (Attila), Scourge of God, they confronted the
civilized and semi-civilized world in arms on the plain of
Chalons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Battle.</span></h3>

<p>From early dawn even until darkness frowned over the
field the blood-feast flowed: and Death was satiated.</p>

<p>Attila withdrew to his camp. He left an effective guard
around his wagons and outposts and made every thing ready for
a prolonged and obstinate resistance to the attack anticipated at
early dawn. Nevertheless he built for himself a massive funeral
pile, placed upon it his most valued treasures and his favorite
wives, and was fully prepared and resolute to apply the torch,
ascend the pyre, and so perish in the flames&mdash;should defeat fall
to his fortune on the following day.</p>

<p>Morning dawned. The awful work of death on the preceding
day appalled both armies; miles upon miles of outstretched plain
lay covered with carnage; the all-night-writhing mounds of men
were ominously still. Sullenly did foe gaze upon foe; but each
recoiled from renewal of the slaughter.</p>

<p>Still the advantage was with the allies; for Attila, so late
the fierce aggressor, was barricaded in his camp&mdash;tho’ grimly
awaiting attack indeed, and prepared to resist to the end and
die like a lion in his den.</p>

<p>Did the Romans know of that funeral pile? They may not,
indeed, have known the peculiar manner in which Attila would
seek death, but they knew that he would die by his own hand&mdash;if
the worst came. Cato had done so and Varus and Brutus
and Cassius and Hannibal and Anthony and Cleopatra&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Addison, in his tragedy <cite>Cato</cite>, has graphically portrayed the
conflicting thoughts and emotions in the mind of a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
feels that life cannot longer be borne and yet shrinks back from
the horror and the dread unknown.</p>

<p>Cato had lost the battle of Utica. He had been true to
Pompey, he had fought the last battle for the cause of Pompey&mdash;and
lost. And Cæsar was indeed god of this world, and the
morrow held no place on all this so vast earth for Cato; this
lost-battle night must end it all. He read Plato’s discourse on
the immortality of the soul, and in the lines of Addison, thus
soliloquized:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“It must be so. Plato, thou reason’st well:</p>
<p class="verse">Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,</p>
<p class="verse">This longing after immortality?</p>
<p class="verse">Or whence this secret dread and inward horror</p>
<p class="verse">Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul</p>
<p class="verse">Back on herself and startles at destruction?</p>
<p class="verse">’Tis the divinity that stirs within us;</p>
<p class="verse">’Tis Heaven itself that points out an hereafter,</p>
<p class="verse">And intimates eternity to man.</p>
<p class="verse6">* <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span></p>
<p class="verse">The soul, secured in her existence, smiles</p>
<p class="verse">At the drawn dagger and defies its point.</p>
<p class="verse">The stars shall fade away, the sun himself</p>
<p class="verse">Grow dim with age and nature sink in years;</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth</p>
<p class="verse">Unhurt amidst the war of elements,</p>
<p class="verse">The wreck of matter and the crash of worlds.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>But Attila did not mount his funeral pile. The day passed
without attack upon Attila’s formidable position. King Theodoric
lay dead upon the plain and his son Prince Thorismund, who
had distinguished himself in the battle, was victoriously proclaimed
King of the Visigoths.</p>

<p>Ætius, Valentinian’s able general, held in leash both the
Romans and the Visigoths even while Attila slowly broke up
camp and withdrew in long lines leading northward.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Effect.</span></h3>

<p>The effect was that of victory for the allies. Rome was saved
from a fresh infusion of barbarism whilst her Teutonic element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was still semi-barbarous. The German characteristics&mdash;love of
liberty, independence, and reverential regard for women&mdash;thus
dominated the Christian civilization which now began to flourish
vigorously out from the decadence of pagan Rome.</p>

<p>If, as Byron says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Cervantes laughed Spain’s chivalry away,”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">then also it may be said that Lucan laughed Rome’s gods and
goddesses away. The laugh is the most insidiously potent of
all destructive forces when the laugher is loved and the times
are attuned to hear. Not satire, not personal bitterness, not
even the withering invectives of a Juvenal are as sweepingly effective
as the quills of ridicule, the inescapable miasma of the
laugh. Once let the grin distort the frown of Zeus and
majesty trembles, awe smiles, reverence dies.</p>

<p>And so the pagan deities were dead; their temples empty
and meaningless; and thundering Jove and jealous Juno and
murderous Mars and all the other deifications of the all too
human heart of man were impotently silent under the spell
of the solemn central figure of the new religion&mdash;Christ on the
Cross.</p>

<p>And the Church in the name and with the power of that
sublime Sufferer taught the reverse of all that paganism had
taught; of all that the world had hitherto heard and heeded;
of all that the all too human heart of man held as dearest and
best. “Love your enemies,” said the Church to the men who
had fought at Chalons. “Blessed are the merciful, Blessed are
the clean of heart, Blessed are the peacemakers”, reiterated the
Church to her semi-barbarous children. And they understood
only in part, and they did deeds of appalling atrocity even while
acquiescing to her teachings: for the will to do good was, indeed,
emotionally present with them, but the power so to do
failed them crucially. Yet their sins were of surface-passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not of the inmost heart; for they were ever in reverential awe
of the sublime Sufferer on the Cross; for he spoke as no man
ever yet had spoken, and he lived what he said, and he died
praying for his murderers: and all this is not of man&mdash;as none
knew better than they who knew the naked human heart.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Attila.</span></h3>

<p>History has not done justice to Attila. History has not done
justice to any lost cause. For the winners, not the losers, are
the writers as well as the makers of history, and all forces combine
to make them unjust to the lost cause.</p>

<p>Herodotus gives us the story of Marathon, Thermopylæ,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Platea, Salamis'">Platæa, Salamis</ins>; Persia had no Herodotus: Homer extols the
exploits of the Grecian army, the valor of Achilles; but Hector
had no Homer: Roman historians tell the story of the Punic
wars; Carthage from her desolate site sown with salt cares not
what they say, whilst Hannibal, bravest of the brave, and
supreme military genius, speaks on the historic page only from
the lips of the hated Romans.</p>

<p>When Protestantism finally won in England and the long
able reign of Elizabeth established it firmly upon a political
basis, then were fulminated against the Church of Rome all those
unjust accusations and gross misrepresentations which, crystallized
in history and in literature, seem ineradicable as fate.
But truth is older than history or literature, and more analytically
powerful than the synthetic forces of crystallization, and
patiently prevalent even over fate.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s very legitimacy depended upon the establishment
of Protestantism in England and the overthrow of Catholicity;
and to this two-fold end the energies of the very astute daughter
of Henry VIII. were undeviatingly directed.</p>

<p>It takes about three hundred years from the time of a cataclysmic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'upheavel of any'">upheaval of any</ins> kind before the minds of men can view
it dispassionately or estimate it without bias. But what are
three hundred years to age-old Truth?</p>

<p>Elizabeth possessed, in addition to the terse Tudor qualities,
the rare gift of foresight. She knew the power of the pen and
the possibilities for fame or infamy in the men of genius of her
time. And so her court was open to the great men of that day
and her smile of patronage was ever ready to welcome poet,
artist, dramatist, politician, warrior, traveler, historian, and
statesman: she became all to all and she won all.</p>

<p>As <em>Gloriana</em> in Spenser’s immortal “Færie Queen” she reigns
forever. Bacon, Spenser, Sidney Smith, Raleigh, Voltaire&mdash;as
Voices having a thousand echoes throughout the years&mdash;have
amply rewarded that patient foresight and have fixed her in
fame as&mdash;what she was to them&mdash;Good Queen Bess.</p>

<p>And so Attila and his Huns in low long sinuously winding
northern lines left behind them the carnage strewn plain of
Chalons, and the camp with its ominous pyre, and the dazed foe.
And thus victory remained to Ætius, last of the Romans: and
the field of Chalons which saved civilization and semi-civilization
from an untimely intrusion of rank barbarism; which secured
domination to the Teutonic race rather than to the Sarmatic;
which freed Europe from Asia&mdash;was the last victory of imperial
Rome.</p>

<p>Attila died two years later; some say as the victim of poison
secretly mixed with his food by Ætius’ ever vigilant spies.
With him his vast empire passed away: and the leader who once
claimed as proud titles,&mdash;“Atzel, Descendant of the Great Nimrod.
By the Grace of God, King of the Huns, the Goths, the
Danes, and the Medes. The Dread of the World”&mdash;died ignominiously
one carousal wedding night: and history, ever unjust
to a lost cause, writes his name among the <em>Almosts</em> and
calmly commends the destiny by which Attila and his Hunnish
hordes were defeated in the great battle of Chalons.</p>

<span class="fs130">TOURS</span></h2>


<p>The battle of Tours had as result the dominance of the Aryan
race over the Semitic in Europe; and of the Cross over the
Crescent throughout the world. As Gibbon says speaking of the
phenomenal conquests of the followers of Mohammed: “A victorious
line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles
from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the
repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to
the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine
is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian
fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the
mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran
might now be taught in the Schools of Oxford, and her pulpits
might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and
truth of the revelation of Mahomet. From such calamities was
Christendom delivered by the genius and fortune of one man.”
(Charles Martel).</p>

<p>Persia, Lydia, northern Africa, Spain, had successively fallen
under the devouring zeal of the fanatics of the desert. Hot
and arid and consuming as the sun o’er yellow sands was the
inspiration of the Prophet fire-breathing thro’ the Koran. “The
sword,” says Mahomet, “is the key of heaven. A drop of blood
shed in the cause of God is of more avail than two months of
fasting and prayer; whoso falls in battle, all his sins are forgiven;
at the day of judgment his wounds shall be as resplendent
as vermillion and odoriferous as musk.” Hearts thus
athirsting aflame had as their dream-goal, their vermillion glory&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
conquest and subjugation of the city of the Cæsars, the
city of the Church, Rome, Immortal Rome.</p>

<p>From the Bosphorus to the Gibraltar glowed the victor Crescent
with extremities burning into Europe. Unsuccessful on the
Bosphorus but successful on the Gibraltar, Spain was soon enveloped
in its fanatic fire and its flame-tongues darted over the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The Saracens of Spain were commanded by Abderame, favorite
of the caliph Hashen, victor of many fields, idol of the
army, and devout believer in the promises of the Prophet. Abderame
was proud of his battle scars, not yet indeed resplendent
as vermillion and odoriferous as musk, but potentially so and
cherished accordingly. He would yet slay “many cut-throat
dogs of misbelievers” and so gain more vermillion. One is here
tempted to say, in the words of Virgil describing the sacrifice of
Iphigenia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse6">“Learn thou then</p>
<p class="verse">To what damned deeds religion urges men.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Too bad that the word “religion” must needs do service to
express the extravagances of mythology, the ravings of
fanaticism, and the teachings of the gentle Christ.</p>

<p>Eudes, duke of Aquitaine, first opposed the Moslems as they
advanced beyond the Pyrenees. He was at first successful but
later suffered a signal defeat at Toulouse, “in so much so”, says
an old chronicler, “that only God could count the number of
Christians slain.” Eudes himself escaped and hastening northward
sought the aid of Charles, duke of Austrasia, mayor of the
palace, and soon to be known as Charles Martel (Charles the
Hammer.)</p>

<p>On came the conquering Saracen hosts, grown insolent by
victory, deeming themselves invincible, and proudly confident in
the destiny that should lead them to Rome. Asia and Africa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
were in arms against Europe; the old against the new; maturity
against lusty youth; and they met steel to steel on the plains
of Tours.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“He either fears his fate too much</p>
<p class="verse4">Or his deserts are small;</p>
<p class="verse">Who dares not put it to the touch</p>
<p class="verse4">And gain or lose it all.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Tours towers in solemn awe in the vague <em>What might have
been</em>. Was it wise to have risked Christendom on the issue of
one battle? The result says Yes; but&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon what seeming trifles turns the hinge of destiny! The
casting-vote of Callimachus, urged by the eloquence of Miltiades,
made Marathon; panic-fear let loose among Darius’ million men
made Arbela; an eclipse of the sun won at Zama; Teutoberger
Wald, Chalons, Tours&mdash;invisible, unknown, but not the less
effective were the forces in these fights making fatefully for defeat
and for victory. That which we term a trifle may be as a
single bead of perspiration; trifling in itself, no doubt, but representative
of a force far from trifling.</p>

<p>Battle raged indecisively all day long from early light till
dark. Prince Charles seemed to wield the hammer of Thor.
Abderame fell. The Saracens withdrew sullenly within their
tents. Quiet darkness gathered mournfully over the living, the
dying, and the dead.</p>

<p>And the next morning there was a great silence in the Moslem
camp; in so much that the Christians trembled as at some
uncanny treachery and stood awaiting they knew not what.
But as the early morning hours passed and broad daylight
brought back manly courage, the Christian army approached
the camp of the enemy. It was deserted. The foe had fled.
Christendom had won.</p>

<p>Charles did not immediately pursue the fleeing Moslem
hordes. He still feared treachery. Perhaps, too, some wakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sentiment of humanity restrained him from further bloodshed.
The vast plains of Tours were covered with ghastly forms
horribly hacked and hewed but now strangely still. According
to an old chronicle the number of Moslem dead upon the field
of Tours was three hundred and fifty thousand; that of the
Christians, fifteen hundred. Surely that was enough of
slaughtering death even for Karl Martel.</p>

<p>The battle of Tours was fought Oct. 4, 732 A. D. The following
Spring Charles went in pursuit of the Saracens who
were still ravaging southern France. They withdrew from
place to place as Charles drew near; and ultimately&mdash;without
risking another encounter with the Hammer of Thor&mdash;they retired
across the Pyrenees. France was freed from the Crescent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Eighth Century.</span></h3>

<p>All writers agree that the eighth century was the darkest
age of the so-called Dark Ages. The Benedictine monks, authors
of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’ histoire litteraire de la France</cite> say that the eighth
century was <em>the darkest, the most ignorant, the most barbarous</em>
that France had ever seen. It seemed to be the seething culmination
of four hundred years of Barbarism, one infusion following
fast upon another.</p>

<p>In 407 A. D. the Vandals from the upper Rhine invaded Gaul
and Germany: in 410 the West Goths under Alaric besieged and
sacked Rome: in 429 the Vandals under Genseric came down
upon Numidia and Mauritania: in 443 the Burgundian invaders
settled on the upper Rhone and on the Saone: in 451 came the
Huns under Attila. Towards the end of the fifth century the
Franks from the lower Rhine came into Gaul, destroying every
vestige of civilization that had survived the invasion and occupation
of France by the Vandals and Burgundians. About this
time, too, the Angles and Saxons established themselves in Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the Visigoths in Spain. In the sixth and seventh centuries
the Heruli, the East Goths, and the Lombards destroyed
whatever remained of Roman civilization in northern Italy.</p>

<p>And now to complete this scene of chaotic confusion came
the fanatic Moslem hordes from the south. Surely every remaining
reminder of old-world civilization seemed about to be crushed
and broken to pieces between these contending crest waves
of barbarism. The cataclysmic clash and crash came at the
battle of Tours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Church.</span></h3>

<p>William Turner, S. T. D. in his History of Philosophy speaking
of the eighth century says: “We can scarcely realize the
desolation that during these centuries reigned throughout what
had been the Roman Empire. Although surrounded by all the
external signs and conditions of dissolution and decay, the
Church remained true to her mission of moral and intellectual
enlightenment, drawing the nations to her by the very grandeur
of her confidence in her mission of peace, and by the sheer force
of her obstinate belief in her own ability to lift the new peoples
to a higher spiritual and intellectual life. It was these traits in
the character of the Church that especially attracted the barbarian
kings. But, though towards the end of the fifth century
Clovis became a Christian, it was not until the beginning of the
ninth century that the efforts of the Church to reconquer the
countries of Europe to civilization began to show visible results.
The Merovingian kings&mdash;the ‘do-nothing-kings,’ as they
were styled&mdash;could scarcely be called civilized. Even Charlemagne,
who was the third of the Carolingian dynasty, could
hardly write his name.”</p>

<p>The Church is for all ages and all conditions of men. She
is equally effective in answering the soul-questionings of savage
peoples, barbarous, semi-civilized, cultured, and æsthetic: of a
superstitious monk of the Thebaid and of the philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo: of a Thais of the desert and of
Ursula, virgin and martyr: of Charles Martel, of the bloody
battle Tours, and the gentle Francis <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Assissi'">of Assisi</ins>: of Constantine,
Clovis, Charlemagne; and of John Henry Cardinal Newman,
Mangan, Oscar Wilde, Strindberg, and Francis Thompson. As
the manna that fell from heaven for the Israelites had in it
every taste that might be in accordance with the peculiar desire
of him who tasted, so in like manner, the Church of all ages
has ever brought to her children that which was in accordance
with their peculiar needs and desires. Fiercely kind, sternly
kind, firmly kind, humanly kind, and divinely kind&mdash;as occasion
may require, the Church has been and may be.</p>

<p>In Charles Martel, hero of Tours, the Church had a gallant
defender. Under his son Pepin, and his greater grandson
Charlemagne, the Church made that leap forward, away from
ninth century barbarism, up and onward to her fair and full
flowering in the thirteenth century <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Rennaissance'">Renaissance</ins>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Greek Fire.</span></h3>

<p>At the second siege of Constantinople, when Moslemah with
a land force of one hundred twenty thousand Arabs and Persians
stood ready to attack the city; and a fleet of eighteen hundred
ships&mdash;as a moving forest,&mdash;covered the Bosphorus, Constantinople
seemed doomed. A night attack of the combined land
and sea forces was planned; and no one might reasonably doubt
the issue of the conflict. But here again the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>Truly the race is not to the swift nor is the battle to the
strong. Marathon, Salamis, Arbela, Tours, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Cressy, Potiers'">Cressy, Poitiers</ins>,
Agincourt, Saratoga, Valmy,&mdash;were battles not to the strong.
“There’s a divinity that shapes our ends.”</p>

<p>As night approached and the formidable “moving forest”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
gathered round the doomed city, suddenly there darted amidst
the towering timbers&mdash;lighted monsters, Greek Fire-ships belching
forth from dragon-mouthed prows the fatal Greek Fire.
Here, there, everywhere plunged the fire-breathing ships leaving
behind them Moslem vessels in flames. The Bosphorus was on
fire. Of the fated soldiers in that mighty fleet of eighteen
hundred ships, few escaped to make known the tragedy or to
describe the horribly magnificent scene.</p>

<p>What was the Greek Fire? how compounded? how used?
how propelled? does the world of today know the secret of
Greek Fire? <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Gibbons says:'">Gibbon says:</ins> “The historian who presumes to
analyze this extraordinary composition should suspect his own
ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides, so prone to the
marvelous, so careless, and, in this instance, so jealous of the
truth. From their obscure, and perhaps fallacious, hints it
should seem that the principal ingredient of the Greek Fire was
the naphtha, or liquid bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable
oil, which springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon
as it comes in contact with the air. The naphtha was mingled,
I know not by what methods or in what proportions, with sulphur
and with pitch that is extracted from evergreen firs. From
this mixture, which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion,
proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame, which not only
rose in perpendicular ascent, but likewise burnt with equal
vehemence in descent or lateral progress; instead of being extinguished,
it was nourished and quickened by the element of
water; and sand or vinegar were the only remedies that could
damp the fury of this powerful agent, which was justly denominated
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'by the Greks'">by the Greeks</ins> the <em>liquid</em> or the <em>maritime</em> fire. For the
annoyance of the enemy it was employed, with equal effect,
by sea and land, in battles or in sieges. It was either poured
from the rampart in large boilers, or launched in red-hot balls
of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins, twisted round
with wax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the inflammable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
oil; sometimes it was deposited in fire-ships, the victims and
instruments of a more ample revenge, and was most commonly
blown through long tubes of copper which were planted on the
prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped into the mouths of
savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and
consuming fire.”</p>

<p>The paralyzing effect of fear let loose among a multitude of
men has decisively determined many a battle. When the Romans
saw elephants for the first time, and saw them too, in the
midst of Pyrrhus’ hostile hosts bearing down upon them&mdash;those
brave world-conquerors promptly turned and fled. Chariots armed
with scythes madly rushing down upon a body of infantry,
were used with success by the Britons against Cæsar’s terrified
legions. And Greek Fire, Byzantium’s secret for four hundred
years, infused such enduring terror into the hearts of the nations
that had taken part in that night attack upon Constantinople,
that this remembering fear, rather than the effective
force of Byzantium, may be said to have saved Christendom.</p>

<p>By the defeat of Tours in the west and the failure of the
siege in the east, the two horns of the Crescent, burning into
Europe, were effectively repulsed and chilled. Mohammedanism
with its threefold blight&mdash;propagation by the sword, polygamy,
and religious intolerance&mdash;was swept back into Asia, leaving
Europe to develop under the milder sway of Christianity.</p>

<p>Writers of note are unanimous in attributing to the victory
of Charles Martel over the Saracens at Tours the deliverance
of Europe from the thraldom of Mahomet. Even Gibbon
so characteristically fond of “Snapping a solemn creed with
solemn sneer” speaks of this battle as “the event that rescued
our ancestors of Britain and our neighbors of Gaul from the
civil and religious yoke of the Koran.” Arnold speaks of this
victory as “among those signal deliverances which have effected
for centuries the happiness of mankind.” The historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Ranke writing of this period points out as “one of the most important
epochs in the history of the world, the commencement
of the eighth century, when on one side Mohammedanism
threatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the
ancient idolatry of Saxony and Friesland once more forced its
way across the Rhine. In this peril of Christian institutions,
a youthful prince of Germanic race, Karl Martell, arose as their
champion, maintained them with all the energy which the necessity
for self-defense calls forth, and finally extended them into
new regions.” Schlegel, with devoutly grateful heart, tells of
this “mighty victory whereby the arm of Charles Martel saved
and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the deadly
grasp of all-destroying Islam.”</p>

Persia: <em>if</em> the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Pelopenessian War'">Peloponnesian War</ins> had not mutually destroyed

<p>But we are a perennially hopeful race and happily unimaginative

acquiesce when grave historians tell us that in each and
every historic struggle the juggernaut determinant of the <em>If</em>
acted favorably to the best interests of civilization and progress:
so, too, would we obligingly believe had the determinant favored
the opposing cause. Perhaps to all-conquering Progress as to
world-conquering Rome, all battles are victories; either as a
victory proper with roll of triumph-drum and flash of conquering
colors, or as that grim Cannæ-defeat potential of a future
Zama-victory.</p>

<p>It is well that there should be two possible interpretations of
the answers of the oracle: thus is Truth ever serenely secure
unperturbed by the errors of mortals.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pegasus.</span></h3>

<p>It is hard to control the winged steed. His next flight and
whereabouts of alighting are as happily unknown to the rider
as to the beholder&mdash;to the writer as to the reader. However
Pegasus, the real, can never fail to be interesting whether he
leap over the historic ages, or play antics on an <em>If</em>, or neigh irreverently
in the temple of Delphian Apollo, or speed to the
finding of Harold Godwin amid the indistinguishably dead on
the slaughter-field of Senlac-Hastings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rollo the Dane.</span></h3>

<p>Vikings of the northern seas, wolf-men of the Sagas, dark devotees
of Thor, heirs of Valkirie&mdash;little wonder that the semi-civilized
world shuddered at their distant approach; little
wonder that Charlemagne, hero of a hundred wars, grew sick
at heart, foreseeing the rivers of blood that should deluge fair
France, when, one day, by chance, his eagle gaze caught sight
of the Dragon-Head long-boats of the Northmen as yet far off,
red-glittering on shaggy northern seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Time passed; the Charlemagne vision had dread realization;
France, England, Southern Europe were overrun by conquering
Saxon, Dane, Norsemen.</p>

<p>And Rollo of Norway, called Rollo the Dane, settled in
northern France. He named that part of the country Normandy
in honor of his native land. After many years of
bloodshed and as advancing age subdued the battle fever, he
entered into a compromise compact with Charles the Simple of
France. Rollo was to do homage to the king, be baptized, and
marry Giselle, the king’s daughter: in return he should be
acknowledged as the lawful Duke of Normandy with right of
succession to his heirs forever. But rough old Rollo protested
against the humiliating conditions of the homage ceremony. It
was obligingly agreed that it should be done by proxy. History
relates that the warrior appointed as proxy in the homage
ceremony felt deeply the humiliation of having to kiss the slippered
foot of King Charles and that in this act he rudely raised
the foot so high that the monarch was unseated and fell from
his chair. Amid the wild hilarity caused by this scene and the
seeming revival of barbarism, King Charles was too fearful of
Rollo to make open complaint: concealing his chagrin he proceeded
with the ceremony and no doubt felt happily relieved
when all was over, and Rollo at the head of his wild followers
stood forth as Robert, the first Duke of Normandy. The baptism
and the marriage followed in due succession and thus
was won over and fixed in civilization, Christianity, and historic
fame Rollo the Dane, forefather of six dukes of Normandy, and
of a long line of English kings extending directly or indirectly
from William the Conqueror to Queen Anne, last of the Stuarts.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">William of Normandy.</span></h3>

<p>William was the son of Robert, sixth duke of Normandy:
William’s mother was Arlotte, a peasant girl, daughter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
humble tanner of Falaise. William was reared at the court
of his father, and being a beautiful and precocious boy as well as
heir apparent of the realm, he became a great favorite among
the warrior courtiers of Duke Robert.</p>

<p>The magic of danger, the lure of the unknown, the glamour
of romance and chivalry lay, at that time, in a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land. Thither turned the eyes of the half-civilized
descendants of the savage old Vikings; and, as the war fever
of youth abated, many men, combining incongruously remorse
for crimes and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'pentinential expiation'">penitential expiation</ins> with love of daring adventure,
turned away from strong feudal castles and lordly
possessions in Europe to brave the hardships and uncertainties
of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Among those thus lured
into fatal uncertainties was Robert le Diable, sixth Duke of
Normandy. He left the realm to his son William&mdash;if by chance
he himself should not return&mdash;appointed Alan of Brittany regent
during William’s minority, and having left the boy safe
at the court of Henry of France, Robert set out on that pilgrimage
to the Holy Land from which he never returned.</p>

<p>Ever insatiably hungry is the heart of man. Pleasure is a
mirage. Yet perhaps, happier is it to fall and perish in full
pursuit of an ever receding pleasure than to walk inane in the
beaten sand-way and&mdash;live. To do is easier than to endure:
to act is easier than to wait; to roam abroad and strive is
easier than to stay at home and pray; to wander amid strange
scenes and stranger men, to draw the approving sword in a
cause approved, to fight and die and leave his bones to bleach
on Asiatic plains were easier far for Rollo’s blood than to
wait and waste away secure in a feudal fortress of Normandy.</p>

<p>At Robert’s death there were various claimants to his possessions;
but, finally, owing, in great measure, to the fidelity of
the regent Allan of Brittany, the dukedom was secured for
William. He left the court of Paris, and soon after, taking full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
possession of the realm, he began to exhibit those indomitable
character qualifications which together with his military education
and robust physical powers led him on from conquest to
conquest even unto the tragic culmination at Senlac-Hastings
from which he came forth blood-baptized as William the Conqueror.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lady Emma, Pearl of Normandy.</span></h3>

<p>When Ethelred, the Saxon King of England, fled from his
realm and left it to the victorious Danes, he sought refuge at
the court of Richard, the fourth duke of Normandy. There he
met and married the Lady Emma, sister of Duke Richard. This
lady was famed for her beauty and known throughout the realm
as the Pearl of Normandy.</p>

<p>Edward of England, known in England as Edward the Confessor,
was the son of Ethelred and Lady Emma; and it was
upon this relationship that William, at the time of Edward’s
death, laid claim to the crown. Whatever may be said of this
claim, it was at least more tangible than that of Harold, son of
Earl Godwin.</p>

<p>The days have gone by when the rights of blood relationship
were claims for which contending realms might squander fortunes
and armies: but he who estimates the ages past by the
standards of today, would better roll up and read no more the
enigmatic scrolls of history. Rivers of blood have freely flowed
in order that some royal rascal, slightly richer in royal rascality
than a rival claimant, might win a throne. Yet we who cannot
understand the code of the <em>Samurai</em>, as worked out logically
today; we to whom the principles of <em>Bushido</em>, when carried to
the last full measure of devotion, are fascinatingly unreal; we
to whom <em>jun-shi</em>, <em>hari-kiri</em>, <em>seppuku</em> are words ominous, indeed,
but unintelligible even when translated into deed in the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
light of today<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;how shall we be able to understand or estimate
aright the mysteries of the mighty past!</p>

<p>So upon this faint claim of relationship, William, the seventh
duke of Normandy, nephew of Lady Emma, Queen of England,
founded his right to the English throne: and for better or worse,
right or wrong, faint claim or no claim&mdash;he won.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Matilda of Flanders.</span></h3>

<p>William sought to strengthen his position by an influential
matrimonial alliance. Matilda, daughter of the Duke of
Flanders, became the object of his choice. This lady was very
beautiful and an adept in the accomplishments of her time&mdash;music
and tapestry weaving. In fact a wonderful piece of
tapestry known as the Bayeaux Tapestry and even now in a
state of comparative preservation, is said to have been the work
of Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror. This
famous piece of embroidery on linen is four hundred feet long
and nearly two feet wide; it is a series of designs illustrating
the various events and incidents of the Battle of Hastings and
other exploits of the Conqueror.</p>

<p>William and Matilda were married in 1052, the Battle of
Hastings was fought in 1066, so that the Bayeaux Tapestry has
resisted the gnawing tooth of time for more than eight hundred
years.</p>

<p>Who shall unerringly perceive in the glare of the passing day,
what is great, what small: what is enduring, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'what evancescent'">what evanescent</ins>!
Linen fibres, silken threads, a woman’s needlework&mdash;endure:
shields, helmets, swords, battle axes, all the iron horrors of Hastings
have passed away.</p>

<p>And the moral values of the passing hour are, to human perception,
equally elusive, intangible, untraceable. But are we
called upon to understand the full meaning of the passing show?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>Surely the Power above us smiles at our endeavors to fit together
here in Time things whose fitness shall not have developed in a
thousand years.</p>

<p>The old Norse story runs that when Thor went to Jotun-heim,
the home of the Giants, he failed ignominiously in the accomplishments
of the tasks imposed upon him. He struck with might
and main at the head of the prostrate giant Skrymir, but the
huge creature only moved restlessly and murmured in his sleep
that a leaf or twig had fallen upon his face. Thor failed in the
race with Hugi. Thor failed in the drinking bout proposed by
Utgard-Loki. Thor failed in the wresting match with Elli, the
old nurse of Utgard-Loki. Thor failed to lift the Giant’s sleeping
cat, and though he tugged with all his strength, he succeeded
in lifting only one paw from the ground. Thor failed
apparently in every task that was set before him.</p>

<p>But, behold! when revelation was made, it was found that
Thor had, indeed, been Thor and that his failure-achievements
had terrified even the Norns. For the giant Skrymir later confessed
to Thor that by magic he had shielded his head with a
mountain when Thor struck with his hammer, and that the
mountain had been well nigh severed by the blow. And as to
the race with Hugi, why Hugi is Thought; and no man may
hope to surpass the speed of thought. And as to Thor’s failure
in the drinking bout, why the drinking horn had been secretly
in connection with the ocean, and Thor’s deep draughts had
seriously lowered old ocean’s vast domain. And as to Elli, the
nurse, why she was Old Age and her no mortal may overcome.
And as to Thor’s failure to lift the sleeping cat&mdash;why the seeming
cat had been in dread reality, the Midgard serpent coiled
around the world, and his nearly successful efforts to rouse the
serpent and tear it from the charmed circle, had terrified even
the Norns. And so Thor was still Thor in his failure-achievements
in Jotun-heim: so likewise may we, in the great Revelation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
be found to have been splendid conquerors in the grim failure-strife
of Time. And then, too, shall a fateful Skrymir make
known to us the true nature of the forces against which we
strove; the fatal necessity of failure in such a strife, were we
Thor or even Odin: then too shall we learn with astonishment
and delight the Herculean results of our labors; and throughout
all the upward cycles of our immortality we shall be stronger
and better because of our failure-achievements down in earth’s
Jotun-heim.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Monasteries.</span></h3>

<p>As there was some tie of consanguinity between William and
Matilda, their marriage could take place only by special dispensation
from the Pope. After some vexatious delays, however,
this dispensation was obtained, but William and Matilda
were advised by the Pope to erect a Hospital for incurable
patients and two monasteries, one for men, the other for women.</p>

<p>William and Matilda joyfully agreed to fulfill these conditions.
The hospital was built first, and later two imposing
monastic piles, one under the special patronage of Matilda, the
other under William, were erected at Cæn. Strange to relate
that after forty or fifty years had passed away, Matilda was
brought to her wedding monument monastery and quietly interred,
and a few years later William was laid to rest in his
wedding monument monastery. And thus near yet apart they
have slept thro’ the long ages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Harold Godwin.</span></h3>

<p>Harold Godwin and William of Normandy were not strangers
to each other when they drew up their battle forces on the field
of Senlac-Hastings. Harold had spent some months in Normandy
at the court of William some years prior to the death of
Edward. And William had made known to Harold his claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to the English throne and his intention of maintaining that claim
when the time should come. History relates that Harold, concealing
his own ambitious designs, vowed solemnly to support
William’s cause.</p>

<p>At the death of Edward, however, Harold found himself at
the head of a powerful Saxon faction and felt strong enough
to oppose William, should he persist in his intent to claim the
throne.</p>

<p>But what about that oath made solemnly in the presence of
the Sacrament! Is a man ever courageously self-respecting
and invincibly valiant in whose soul festers the ulcer&mdash;perjury!
When Richard the Third went forth to battle upon Bosworth
field, he was already defeated and slain by his own avenging
conscience.</p>

<p>When Harold heard of the landing of William’s Norman
troops at Pevensey, he was then in the north of England
engaged in a struggle with the Danes under the leadership
of his own brother Tostig. Harold was slightly wounded in this
battle but, in the end, Tostig lay dead upon the field and the
Danes were put to flight. Thus from a battlefield red with a
brother’s blood, Harold, a wounded man and a perjured man
hastened southward to his fate in the dread slaughter of Hastings.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“And were things only called by their right name,</p>
<p class="verse">Cæsar himself would be ashamed of fame.”&mdash;<cite>Byron.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The word <em>battlefield</em> is a euphemism for human shambles. And
“the chief who in triumph advances” is, in grim reality, but
the lustiest and the bloodiest of the dogs of war. And the
Alexanders, Cæsars, Napoleons are the madmen who have made
men mad by their contagion, and have so accumulated horrors
Pelion-Ossa piled on horrors as to make the angels weep o’er
this mad planet of the universe.</p>

<p>A forceful peculiarity of mental unsoundness is the vehemence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with which its victim conceives himself to be right and
everybody else wrong, himself sane and all not in agreement
with him insane. This fatuity is characteristic of ages as well
as of individuals. It is manifest in the complaisant superiority
which every age, every generation assumes toward the immediately
preceding. “Back in the past, during the Dark Ages,
in primitive times, etc.” are the words of balm with which the
passing hour begins its own eulogy.</p>

<p>But blood is blood and hate is hate and war is war, whether
waged by Macedonian Alexander B. C. 331, or by the Balkan
forces A. D. 1912. Shades of the fallen upon that age-long
battle ground! wouldn’t you feel strangely at home in the fray
if by any chance you should come to life today?</p>

<p>International courts of justice, arbitration, disarmament,
World-Peace&mdash;will they ever prevail? Knowing the past, knowing
the heart of man, we answer <em>No</em>: dreaming of the future,
dreaming of the godlike in the heart of man, we answer <em>Yes</em>.</p>

<p>So all day long the tide of battle rolled&mdash;from early day
till dark. And William and his Norman followers were in possession
of the field, and round them lay a host of dead and wounded,
yet by reason of the sudden darkness and the exhaustion of
the troops, no search could be made even for the Norman
wounded: and tho’ groans and cries of thirst and deep sighings
arose incessantly from the writhing masses just darker than
the darkness, yet no search could be made or any aid given
by reason of the utter exhaustion of the troops.</p>

<p>And on that field of death and awfully dying life Harold
Godwin lay happily dead under a heap of the slain. Two
monks, lanterns in hand, went out to search for him and with
them went also the mother of Harold and Edith the woman that
loved him. After hours of fruitless search amid scenes of gruesome
horror, and as the dawn burst in red wonder over a bleeding
world, Edith discovered Harold. So changed was he, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mutilated, hacked and hewed, blood-clotted, dismembered, that
even his mother knew him not but the woman that loved him
knew. With great difficulty was the body of Harold extricated
from under the heap of the slain, but the monks and the
women persevered at their task and finally bore him away.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">William the Conqueror.</span></h3>

<p>We know only what life has brought within our own cognition;
beyond that all is conjecture. The love turned to hate
and delighting in the avenging pangs of a lover is utterly uncognizable
by the man or woman unto whom love is love forevermore.
Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s weird poem “Sister Helen” is,
thank God, quite meaningless to the greater number of women:
and yet such women as Sister Helen exist; they know each other;
they understand the poem.</p>

<p>Strange, indeed, was that practice among primitive people,
of injuring an image of an enemy and claiming that thereby,
in like manner, they injured the enemy. In the poem referred
to, the woman is engaged in the magic rite of holding a waxen
image in the flame and letting it slowly consume under incantation.
She is interrupted from time to time by her wondering
little brother, and in her answers to him Helen makes
known her wrongs, her slighted love, her love turned to hate,
her revenge, her vindictive madness, her black-art vengeance
reaching even beyond the grave, her triumph-despair. At the
end of the incantation as for the seventh time she turns the
waxen figure and it breaks up and melts dripping away&mdash;her
perjured lover dies.</p>

<p>A formula of this magic rite runs as follows:</p>

<p>“Take parings, nails, hair, saliva, etc., of your victim and
make them up into his likeness with wax from a deserted bees’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
comb. Hold the waxen image in slow flame for seven consecutive
nights repeating intently over the image&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘It is not wax that I am scorching,</p>
<p class="verse">It is the liver, heart, spleen of <em>So and So</em>.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>After the seventh time, turn your figure and your victim’s
life will go out with the last drippings of the wax into the
flame.”</p>

<p>Gladly would we relegate this grotesque rite back to the
twilight of animistic superstitions: but if we are vitally in
touch both with the past and with the passing hour, we dare not
do so. There is subtle relationship between this concretely
hideous formula of other days and such abstract expressions&mdash;not
unfamiliar today&mdash;as <em>mental assassination</em>, use of <em>malicious
animal magnetism</em>, hypnotic control of the aura, aggressive telepathic
forces, etc. The garb of the occult changes, adapts itself
with Protean pliability to the passing hour&mdash;but the inscrutable
Occult forever hid behind the Isis-veil, does not change.</p>

<p>It is said of Molière that behind the mask of comedy, he bore
a heart heavy with tragic woe: that his farces are satires on
human nature: that he, more piercingly than any other mortal,
had gazed down into the heart of man. Perhaps for
Molière then, or such as he, the all around understanding
of every act or emotion is sympathetically possible, but to the
ordinary mortal there is full knowledge only of that which has
come within his own cognition.</p>

<p>Therefore, to depict the feelings of William the Conqueror,
as he stood among the dead and dying on the field of Hastings is
beyond the power of ordinary mortal. Whether he felt elated
or depressed&mdash;for we know that ofttimes in the hour of seeming
triumph there is deadly depression of soul; whether he turned
heartsick from the reproachful glare in dead and dying eyes
and shuddered that such things should be, or gazed delightedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and eagerly upon the sullen silent faces of the Saxon foe:
whether with infinite pity regretful and remorseful he could
have wept for the brave men who lay dead because of him, or
saw them not at all, or, at best, only as stepping stones to a
throne: who shall say? who shall know?</p>

<p>When a man as stoically severe as the late General Nogi,
has by chance been revealed to the world as a tender father
and a man weighed down by fatal woe even whilst he was urging
on the furiously victorious death-charges up the hill of
Port Arthur&mdash;we would willingly suspend judgment as to what
may have been the feelings in the hour of triumph deep down
in the heart of William the Conqueror.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Robert’s Rebellion.</span></h3>

<p>William had left his wife Matilda as regent of Normandy
when he set out for the invasion of England. Robert, the
eldest boy, a bright lad of fourteen and his mother’s idol was
also participant in the regency. As the years rolled by and
the boy grew more able and willing to rule, Matilda willingly
sank to second place in active government and Robert was
in deed if not in title the Duke of Normandy.</p>

<p>Eight years passed by before William found his English
realm calm enough for him to leave it and make a visit to his
old home Normandy. At his coming he found all going on
admirably without him. Matilda was happy in the affection of
her favorite son Robert; and Robert a valiant young prince,
was happy in the love of an over-indulgent mother and the possession
of ducal power. All this was changed when William
came. Perhaps jealousy of the place Robert held in the
affections of Matilda, perhaps insatiable avarice and lust of
power, perhaps unnatural hatred of the son who dared to oppose
the unconquerable will of the Conqueror&mdash;perhaps any or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
all of these feelings intermingling impelled William to act as
he did, but certainly, in the light of calmer times, William’s
conduct towards his son Robert cannot be justified.</p>

<p>Robert was deposed from the place which he held during
the regency and which he had slowly grown to regard as his
own. The proud spirit of the princely youth could not endure
this humiliation. He fled to Flanders, and there among
his mother’s friends and his own followers and retainers, he
gathered together an army and appeared in open rebellion
against his father.</p>

<p>Matilda was, indeed, a devoted wife to William, but she was
an even more devoted mother to her son; and her heart was
torn with grief when hostilities broke out and father and son
were arrayed against each other on the field of battle. It is
related that Robert saved William’s life in the engagement that
followed. Both were in armor and their faces were concealed
by the helmet and visor, so that they did not recognize one
another. In the heat of the strife, Robert saw one of his knights
hurl a javelin at a burly figure on horseback in the opposing
ranks. With a cry and a groan the injured man fell from
his horse, and Robert horrified at the voice which he recognized
as his father’s, rushed headlong to the side of the fallen
man and rescued him from the feet of trampling horses. He
was touched with remorse and wept as William uplifted his
helmet and visor revealing a face white and weary and covered
with blood.</p>

<p>The generous heart of the youth even then might have been
won to better things had William himself been morally high
enough to draw his son higher; but he was not.</p>

<p>That hasty action and as hasty reaction in the hearts of the
young-world children&mdash;hate surging suddenly into remorseful
love, strength into weakness, audacious rebellion into repentant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
submission: and then as hastily surging back again! Robert
saving the life of his father against whom he had come in battle
array: Richard Cœur de Lion bitterly weeping at the bier of
his father whose death he had desired and hastened: Henry I.
who never smiled again after the loss of his son and heir when
the <em>White Ship</em> went down: the Black Prince, chivalrously subservient
to his prisoner King John of France <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'conquered at Portiers'">conquered at
Poitiers</ins>&mdash;strangely fascinating is this hasty action and reaction
in the hearts of the young-world children!</p>

<p>Matilda succeeded in bringing about a reconciliation between
her husband and her son after that strange battle; but it was
only for a time. William was compelled to return to England
and Robert took advantage of this occasion to enforce his
claim on Normandy. Matilda was secretly in favor of her son
(the women are always right!) tho’ she tried to conciliate both.
Rebellion again raged in Normandy openly carried on by
Robert and secretly abetted by Matilda. William was, at the
same time, threatened with an uprising in England and was
obliged to remain on the island. But certainly there could
have been little peace or happiness in the heart of the man
whose subjects were in insurrection against him and in whose
household there was hate and discord and rebellion.</p>

<p>As William became more and more alienated from Robert,
he looked more favorably upon his second son William Rufus
and his third son Henry. These in turn succeeded him upon
the throne of England to the exclusion of Robert, the rightful
heir.</p>

<p>Robert languished in prison the last twenty-seven years of
his life&mdash;thus adding another chapter to the book in which is
recorded the story of men and women who have nearly succeeded
in their ambitious designs&mdash;but not quite: the <em>Almosts</em>
of literature and of life; who have struggled fearfully
and failed; whose fierce activities have died down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dungeon gloom; who have been, in the main, more sinned against
than sinning; who have lived and happily died leaving behind
a tragic name flame-cut into fame.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Exeunt Omnes.</span></h3>

<p>Matilda died in 1082, and about five years later William followed
her to the tomb. Matilda died in the palace part of the
monastery at Cæn erected by William at the time of their marriage.
Her last days were deeply shadowed by the renewal
of hostilities between William and Robert, and by the death of a
daughter, a young and beautiful girl full of hope and promise,
who had suddenly been stricken with an incurable illness.</p>

<p>It was well that in those days in the twilight of the grave,
Matilda could not foresee the sad fate of her son Robert.
Little did that tender mother-heart dream of the destiny overhanging
the boy, when at that last clandestine interview she
hastily blessed him and kissed him good bye. Thank God for
the heavy curtain rolled down impenetrably between the present
and the future.</p>

<p>William, notwithstanding his grievance against Matilda, came
to see her in her last illness. He was with her when she died.
He followed her in the funeral cortege to that monastery built
by her in far off happier days, and he stood sadly by as that
devoted wife and mother of his many children was laid to rest.</p>

<p>Philip of France abetted the cause of Robert, and William,
now an old man and grown excessively corpulent, was forced
again to take up arms. William was under medical treatment for
his corpulency, and Philip, hearing of this, jestingly remarked
that “the old woman of England was in the straw.” A tale-bearer
repeated this to William and in a rage the King swore
that “the old woman of England would soon make things too hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>for him.” William kept his word; burning villages and war
horrors arose on every side as the irate monarch began his
march of revenge.</p>

<p>The town of Mantes, on the road to Paris, was in flames,
and William, riding thro’ and giving out orders in all directions,
failed to notice that his horse was treading upon smoking
ashes. Suddenly the horse reared violently, his feet evidently
having been burnt by smouldering flame, and William
was internally injured. He was borne by litter to a monastery
just outside the gates of Rouen. William soon realized
that he was face to face with the King of Terrors. He shrank
with horror from the remembrance of his deeds: he ordered that
a large sum of money should be given to the poor and that
their prayers should be enlisted in his behalf; he gave orders
that all the churches of Mantes, destroyed by him, should be
at once rebuilt, and he richly endowed the monastery.</p>

<p>His sons William and Henry were soon at his side, but
Robert came not. When asked as to whom he bequeathed the
kingdom of England he replied that it had not been bequeathed
to him, that, therefore, he bequeathed it to no one, but that he
wished that his son William Rufus might succeed him.</p>

<p>William, at last, when he could hold it no longer, left Normandy
to his eldest son Robert.</p>

<p>William tried to make his peace with Heaven as the dread
summons came nearer and nearer. He was one morning suddenly
aroused from a comatose state by the ringing of the
church bells. Hastily arising and thinking himself in the clash
of battle he demanded to know what that clangor meant. On
being told that it was the church bells of St. Mary’s ringing for
morning services, he lifted up his hands, turned his eyes heavenward,
and exclaimed, “I commend myself to my Lady Mary,
the holy Mother of God.” He then sank back and died.</p>

<p>William Rufus succeeded to the throne of England and
after a troubled reign of thirteen years, he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry, the youngest son of William the Conqueror, claimed
the crown and after overcoming his brother Robert in a terrible
battle, he quietly took possession of the throne. Robert
was held a prisoner by Henry I. until death released him twenty-seven
years later.</p>

<p>So long ago were these scenes enacted, and so very long
have the actors slumbered! Would they recognize themselves
in the descriptions given of them today? and would they be
pleased or displeased with the parts attributed to them in the
play?</p>

<p>However all the actors, immediate and mediate, connected
with the battle of Senlac-Hastings have long ago gone off the
stage. The colossal <em>If</em> upon which once hung the history of
England has become fate-fixed actuality. The Houses of Plantagenet,
Lancaster, York, Tudor, Stuart&mdash;England’s story from
1066 to the passing hour are inseparably woven one with the
battle of Senlac-Hastings and the <em>If</em> determinant in favor of
William the Conqueror.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a><a href="#CONTENTS"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></a><br /><br />

<span class="fs130">ORLEANS</span></h2>


<p>What France won in three years (1428-1431) under the
leadership of Joan of Arc restored all that France had lost
during the Hundred Years’ War. Cressy, Poitiers, Agincourt
were negatived by Orleans.</p>

<p>More wonderful than any myth of any nation under the
sun, than any concept of poetic fancy throughout all literatures,
than any vision of poet-sage or seer in all Sybilline rhapsodies&mdash;is
the plain historical narrative of the life and deeds of Joan
of Arc. Some power beyond the natural worked thro’ the
peasant maid of Domremy.</p>

<p>“The people of Orleans when they first saw her in their
city thought that it was an angel from Heaven that had come
down to save them”, said an eye-witness of the scene who
testified at the reversal of Jeanne’s sentence ten years after her
death. On the contrary the Duke of Bedford, in a letter still
extant, writing to Henry VI. and lamenting recent disasters to
the English army says: “And alle thing there prospered for you
til the tyme of the Siege of Orleans taken in hand God knoweth
by what advis.</p>

<p>“At the which tyme, after the adventure fallen to the person
of my cousin of Salisbury, whom God assoile, there fell by
the hand of God as it seemeth, a great strook upon your peuple
that was assembled there in grete nombre, caused in great part
as I trowe, of lakke of sadde beleve, and of unlevefull doubte,
that they had of a disciple and limb of the Feende, called the
Pucelle, that used fals enchantments and sorcerie.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">“So certainly</p>
<p class="verse">As morn returneth in her radiant light</p>
<p class="verse">Infallibly the day of truth shall come”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">said the Maid of Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>That day of truth has come. Around Joan of Arc the
charmed circle of the Church of Rome is drawn. Let no man
dare to call evil that which the Church calls good; let no man
dare to attribute imposture, hysterical exaltation, or necromantic
might to one whom the Church calls Blessed. Vindicated,
rehabilitated, restored, cherished, Blessed is now the
Maid who died five hundred years ago burned at the stake as a
witch.</p>

<p>Condemned by the University of Paris, an ecclesiastical
tribunal? Yes. Hounded to the stake by Pierre Cauchon,
Bishop of Beauvais? Yes. But the Church can shake off and
disclaim the clinging hands of her children whose touch pollutes
her; and the Church of all ages can outshine the lurid darkness
of any one age, and deprecate, and deplore and denounce
the deeds done in that lurid darkness. Splendidly, too, and
with stern magnanimity, defying apparent self-contradiction,
can the Church reverse the decrees of ecclesiastical tribunals,
and stoop down to pick up and restore and rehabilitate and
bless a strangely foolish child whom kings and courts and the
great University of Paris had condemned and cast away.</p>

<p>The Church of the Middle Ages must ever stand darkly
enigmatic to the non-Catholic student of history. He cannot
rightly appreciate the binding force of spiritual authority. The
withering away from fear of Church censure, the clinging claim
upon all the powers of the soul in the prayers and ceremonies
and sacraments of the Church, the isolating horrors of her excommunications,
the abject fear of her spiritual punishments,
powerful alike over prince and potentate and peasant&mdash;are
practically meaningless to the non-Catholic.</p>

<p>That scene in “Richelieu” by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton,
well illustrates the power of the Church in the Middle Ages.
King Louis XIII. has sent to demand that Julie de Mortemar,
Cardinal Richelieu’s orphan ward, shall be immediately sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the court subject to the king’s pleasure. The girl clings to the
Cardinal for protection. To these messengers Cardinal Richelieu
replies,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">“To those who sent you!&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">And say you found the virtue they would slay</p>
<p class="verse">Here&mdash;couched upon this heart, as at an altar,</p>
<p class="verse">And sheltered by the wings of sacred Rome.</p>
<p class="verse">Begone!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>They go. But soon again comes Baradas, favorite of the
king, First Gentleman of the Chamber, and about to be made
premier to succeed the temporarily deposed Cardinal Richelieu.
To Baradas’ insolent importunities the eloquent old Cardinal
in righteous wrath exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">“Ay, is it so?&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Then wakes the power which in the age of iron</p>
<p class="verse">Burst forth to curb the great and raise the low.</p>
<p class="verse">Mark where she stands!&mdash;around her form I draw</p>
<p class="verse">The awful circle of our solemn Church!</p>
<p class="verse">Set but a foot within that holy ground,</p>
<p class="verse">And on thy head&mdash;yea tho’ it wore a crown</p>
<p class="verse">I launch the curse of Rome!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Baradas abashed retires, the king’s suit ceases; the Church
has triumphed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">La Pucelle.</span></h3>

<p>France is assuredly a genius-mad nation: whether genius or
madness shall ultimately prevail is an answerless question. The
Republic shall go down in “a slough of mire and blood” is the
current prophecy today; but, then, France has gone down in
mire and blood many and many a time and, phœnix like, she has
risen and soared aloft led onward and upward by some strong
Genius-Child.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc and Napoleon Bonaparte stand unique in history;
each picked up torn, bleeding, fragmentary France and
restored her to her rightful place in the family of nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
That Napoleon Bonaparte, a man, a soldier, and a master of
opportune occasion, should have rescued France is not wonderful;
but that the Maid of Domremy, a timid girl aged seventeen,
who “knew not how to ride or to handle a sword”, whose
hand never shed blood, should have, amid most inopportune occasion,
prevailed in battle against Talbot, Gladsdale, Falstofe
and the flower of the English Army is, past all credence, wonderful.</p>

<p>France as a nation was extinguished by the Treaty of Troyes.
Isabeau of Bavaria, wife of Charles VI. deliberately and exultantly
aided the trembling hand of the imbecile king as he
signed away his kingdom. Henry VI. of England, infant son
of Henry V. and Catharine, daughter of Charles VI. of France,
was proclaimed heir of the united kingdoms France and England:
later, at the death of Henry V. this child was crowned
at Paris king of England and of France. Isabeau of Bavaria
aided in the coronation ceremony, graciously accepting young
Harry Lancaster as king of France to the exclusion of the
rightful heir, her own son, Charles the dauphin.</p>

<p>As Schiller says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">“Even the murderous bands</p>
<p class="verse">Of the Burgundians, at this spectacle</p>
<p class="verse4">Evinced some token of indignant shame.</p>
<p class="verse">The queen perceived it and addressed the crowds,</p>
<p class="verse4">Exclaiming with loud voice, ‘Be grateful, Frenchmen,</p>
<p class="verse">That I engraft upon a sickly stock</p>
<p class="verse4">A healthy scion, and redeem you from</p>
<p class="verse">The misbegotten son of a mad sire.’”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Surely the first part of Merlin’s prophecy had been ominously
fulfilled: France was lost by a woman. Would a woman
save France? And far away&mdash;among the wooded hills of
Domremy wandered the splendid Dreamer who should, in three
bright, bitter years&mdash;flame-cut into fame forever&mdash;undo what
Isabeau had done, throw off the incubus of alien authority, negative
the Treaty of Troyes, and save France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank God for the enthusiasts, for those who follow their
Voices! Tho’ their way lies thro’ adamantine opposition, they
know it not, their eyes are fixed on the goal; and even as one
in hypnotic somnambulism leaps on from toppling crag to crag
unawed by the sheer depths of yawning destiny o’er which he
strides, so do these enthusiasts press on to the goal: and they
reach it.</p>

<p>Joan appeared at the camp at Blois, clad in a new suit
of brilliant white armor, mounted on a stately black war-horse,
and with a lance in her right hand, which she had learned to
wield with skill and grace. Her head was unhelmeted; so that
all could behold her fair and expressive features, her deep-set
and earnest eyes, and her long black hair, which was parted
across her forehead and bound by a ribbon behind her back.
She wore at her side a small battle-axe, and the consecrated
sword marked on the blade with five crosses which had at her
bidding been taken for her from the shrine of St. Catharine at
Fierbois.</p>

<p>A page carried her banner which she had caused to be
made and embroidered as her Voices enjoined. It was white
satin, strewn with fleurs-de-lis; and on it were the words “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jhesus
Maria</i>”. And thus spectacularly equipped Joan made her appearance
at Orleans at the head of an enthusiastic French army.
The astounded English soldiers could only stare and glare;
and had it not been from their greater fear of their irate commanders,
these brave heroes of Agincourt would have promptly
run away in panic fright from this dread Maid.</p>

<p>Joan advanced towards the besiegers and solemnly admonished
the English generals to desist from their unlawful holding
of Orleans, to withdraw at once from France, and to spare
further bloodshed. Oaths and imprecations and ribald jests
answered her earnest abjuration. Joan returned to her ranks
and gave order for battle. Yet she shrank from the fury of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
strife and her heart recoiled and sickened at the sight of
suffering and death. Joan’s most trustworthy biographer tells
us that her own hand never shed blood.</p>

<p>Joan was wounded at the battle around Orleans; an arrow
from a cross-bow penetrated her armor between the neck and
shoulder and remained fastened in the wound. Joan grew faint
from pain and she suffered La Hire to lead her from the fray.
Recovering herself in a little while, she sat up and withdrew
the arrow with her own hands, then putting a little oil on the
wound, she mounted and galloped back to where the battle was
raging. Joan’s presence reinspired her followers; mad dash
after dash was made against the fort held by Sir John Gladsdale.
The English soldiers, thinking her to have been mortally
wounded, were terrified at her abrupt return. Again Joan
called out to Gladsdale to surrender and spare further bloodshed.
With an oath the infuriated general came out upon the
drawbridge shouting orders for a final desperate assault. As
he stood thus conspicuous between the two armies, a cannon
ball from the town crashed thro’ the drawbridge and Gladsdale
fell and perished in the waters. At the sight of this disaster,
and also at the attack upon the fort under the leadership of
Joan in person, the English army fled. The siege of Orleans
was raised. The long imprisoned Orleannais came forth and
hailed Joan as their deliverer sent from Heaven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charles VII.</span></h3>

<p>The raising of the siege of Orleans was quickly followed
by the decisive battle of Patay in which Talbot, the English
commander, was wounded and taken prisoner together with a
large part of the English army. The way now lay open to
Rheims. Thither marched the victorious French forces under
Joan of Arc carrying with them the perplexed and irresolute
Dauphin. In the cathedral at Rheims, July 17, 1429, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the solemn ceremonies of the coronation of kings, this weakling
was crowned Charles VII. of France.</p>

<p>Perhaps as the son of an imbecile sire and Isabeau of Bavaria,
Charles VII. couldn’t help being what he was. So in the shadow
of that comfortable Lombrosian theory we leave without reproach
the man whom, in the good sunlight of common sense and honest
manhood, we should scathingly reproach as dastard and ingrate.</p>

<p>After the crowning of Charles at Rheims, Joan desired to
withdraw from the king’s service and go back to Domremy. She
declared that her work was done; she, moreover, maintained
that her Voices no longer urged her to remain in the field, or
pointed out unerringly just what she should do. Du Nois and
La Hire prevailed upon her to remain with the army.</p>

<p>Joan was wounded in an unsuccessful attack upon Paris.
And the following spring in a sortie at Compeigne Joan was
taken prisoner by the Burgundians and subsequently sold to the
English.</p>

<p>Joan was cast into prison at Rouen. Here the indignities
to which she was subjected, as related by her biographers, are
almost incredible. The apathy of the fickle French towards
their late “deliverer sent from Heaven”, and the dastardly indifference
of Charles VII. during her imprisonment and throughout
her trial and death form a conspicuous page in the black
book of Human Ingratitude.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tu, Brute!</i> (And thou too, O Brutus!) cried Cæsar as he
fell pierced, indeed, with twenty-three wounds, but slain at the
sight of his beloved Brutus among the murderers. That was
death in death. <em>And if my enemy had done this to me, verily,
I could have borne it. But thou, my friend and my familiar!</em>&mdash;This
agonizing cry&mdash;shrieked so that all the world may hear by
Cæsar, Wolsey, Joan&mdash;rises in bitter silence in many a heart.
Only those we love have power to wound us; and we
stand defenceless, unresenting, dim-wondering, yet loving.

<h3><span class="smcap">Joan’s Voices.</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">My spirit tells me she is sent from God.”&mdash;<cite>Schiller.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>Both the French and the English firmly believed that Joan
of Arc was aided by some preternatural power; but was she
borne upward by “airs from heaven or blasts from hell”?
Burned at the stake as a Witch, Relapsed Heretic, Accurst&mdash;thus
died the Maid whom the Church has raised to her altars.</p>

<p>But ere we too scathingly condemn that scene, disgraceful
alike to the Church and to human nature, which was enacted
in the Rouen market-place May 31, 1531; it might be well to
turn a balancing gaze upon our own Cotton Mather madness
which had its orgies upon Gallows Hill, Salem, June-September
1692. Nor are we of the passing day and hour sufficiently
washed white of the soot of Occultism that we may conspicuously
disclaim the witch-burning at Rouen. In the late Christian
Science rupture accusations of “mental assassination” and the
use of “malicious animal magnetism” were mutually charged.
Just what that may mean in the esoteric circle, I know not;
but full meaning and full knowledge would doubtless ramify
back to Rouen.</p>

<p class="verseq">“There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,</p>
<p class="verse">Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.”</p>

<p>Yes, infinitely more: all that the human eye can see or
the ear hear or the intellect know is but as a shore-lapping wave
of the infinite ocean of the Seen, the Heard, the Known. And
what if some eye be abnormally endowed with vision, or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ear be attuned beyond the normal for hearing, or some finely
fashioned intellect transcend ordinary knowing&mdash;shall it not
inevitably see more or hear more or know more of that infinite
ocean? and shall it not fearlessly and fully make known what
it sees or hears or knows? And then what? Why we gregarious
Little People, spitefully content in limitations, will with
consenting conscience, condemn the witch to death.</p>

<p>Joan’s Voices spoke to her more especially when the church
bells were ringing; they were mild and very kind; they always
spoke soothingly. When their music stilled she lay prostrate
upon the ground and wept because they had left her behind;
because she had not been able to ascend with them and go
home to that waiting Heaven. Joan’s Voices urged her to
become the saviour of France. And when the child remonstrated
that she was only a poor peasant girl and did not
know how to ride a horse or handle a sword, the Voices insistently
replied, “It is God who commands.” And then the
Maid arose and went forth on that mighty mission.</p>

<p>Orleans, Jargeau, Troyes, Patay, Rheims, Laon, Soissons,
Compeigne, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Beauvias were'">Beauvais were</ins> her victories. Then came the rapid
flame-way of her own emancipation.</p>

<p>As Joan stood bound to the stake, and as the smoke and
flames were hiding her from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulgus profanum</i>, a wild-eyed
monk advanced to the pyre. He held aloft a large iron cross
having upon it an ivory figure of the tortured Christ. A look of
infinite sympathy and love lit up the eyes of Joan as they
rested upon the Christ. Her lips parted in prayer. Blessings
upon Charles VII., prayerful petitions for her beloved France
were heard thro’ the crackling flames. Not once did her eyes
turn from the tortured form upon the cross; thence was coming
the strength that enabled her to bear the pangs of death, thence,
too, the grace which urged her to pray for her murderers.</p>

<p>Round her rolled the fire; her long black hair was blazing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
her head, her face, her wondrous eyes were flooded in flame.
All was ending. But the monk held aloft the Crucifix. A gust
of wind parted the fire, again the charred eyes rested upon the
tortured form on the cross, her lips moved in prayer; and again
she was lost in flames. Thus perished Joan of Arc, aged nineteen,
virgin and martyr.</p>

<p>Take not the ivory Christ away. ’Tis sorrow’s mutual friend;
’tis the strength of strong agony; ’tis the sympathizing consoler
of the rack, the stake, the prison house of pain, the dim valley
of the Shadow, the Rouen sea of flames. The Crucifix understands.</p>

<p>Pan? Well, yes, for the bright blue Arcadian hour in young-heart
Arcady. But for the gray every day and the solemn
night; for the hours of pain and loss and parting and change,
sickness, old age, sorrow; for the crucial crises of life as they
come in bitter pangs to us of a lost Arcady; for the mother
whose boy fell at Vera Cruz; for a Joan of Arc in the flames&mdash;ah!
take your grinning Pan away; we want the Crucifix, we
want the thorny crowned Christ who has suffered and understands.</p>

<p>Ten years after the death of Joan, there was a judicial reversal
of her sentence of condemnation. Twenty-five years later
the Church instituted a thorough investigation of Joan’s claims,
deeds, trial, condemnation, and death. The process and results
of this inquiry may be found in detail in the work “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Proces de
Condemnation et de Rehabilitation de Jeanne D’Arc</span>,” published
in five volumes, by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société de L’Histoire de France</span>.</p>

<p>Many eminent English authors, besides innumerable French
biographers, have written in deep sympathy with Joan of Arc;
among them may be mentioned Southey, Hallam, Carlyle,
Landor, de Quincy, Lang, and our own Mark Twain. Voltaire’s
vulgar burlesque-epic is now generally regarded as an insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to France and a superficial satiric calumny. Schiller in The
“Maid of Orleans” distorts well known historical facts.</p>

<p>In 1869 Mgr. Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans presented at
the Vatican his petition and claims for the beatification of Joan
of Arc. The trial proceeded slowly, but on April 11, 1909,
Pius X., the present reigning pontiff, pronounced the decree
which raised Joan to the first step in the process of canonization.
She was solemnly declared Blessed. “A Mass and Office
of Blessed Joan taken from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commune Virginum</i> with
‘proper’ prayers have been approved of by the Holy See for
use in the diocese of Orleans.” Joan’s canonization is now
under active consideration.</p>

<span class="fs130">LEPANTO</span></h2>


<p>Cross or Crescent! We of the present time can form no
adequate idea of the import couched in those words in mediæval
time. Strange that rivers of blood should flow in the interests
of the cause of the Prince of Peace! Would the Christ,&mdash;who,
dying upon the Cross prayed for his murderers,&mdash;have it so?
Perhaps over his friends even more pitifully than over his
erring inimical world the sublime impetration unceasingly ascends
<em>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do</em>.</p>

<p>And Allah “the mild, the merciful, the compassionate”&mdash;where
was he that tragic Sunday morning October 7, 1571,
when one hundred thousand of his followers, singularly lacking
in his characteristic qualities, stood red-hand in slaughter! Alas
for the ideal when fitted to the real: it is shattered; its shimmering
iridescence dies down gray and dead.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Fight or Not to Fight.</span></h3>

<p>The Ottoman empire, flushed by a long series of successes
under Solyman the Magnificent, had grown insolently aggressive.
The memory of Tours and of Belgrade no longer acted as a
deterrent to the fierce victors of Constantinople; their eyes
were ever turned longingly toward western Europe, and their
dreams were of bloodshed and victory.</p>

<p>The island Cyprus belonged to Venice, but its situation made
it highly desirable as an Ottoman possession; and upon the old
principle that might makes right&mdash;a principle unfortunately
ever retaliatively new&mdash;the Turkish forces besieged Cyprus. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
town Nicosia, capital of Cyprus, fell an easy prey, and the
atrocities committed on the defenceless inhabitants horror-thrilled
the Christian world. Later the town Famagosta after a
prolonged and obstinate resistance was captured but under circumstances
of peculiar malignity. In the words of Prescott:
“While lying off Cephalonia Don John received word that
Famagosta, the second city of Cyprus, had fallen into the hands
of the enemy, and this under circumstances of unparalleled
perfidy and cruelty. The place, after a defence that had cost
hecatombs of lives to the besiegers, was allowed to capitulate
on honorable terms. Mustapha, the Moslem commander, the
same fierce chief who had conducted the siege of Malta, requested
an interview at his quarters with four of the principal Venetian
captains. After a short and angry conference, he ordered
them all to execution. Three were beheaded. The other, a
noble named Bragadina, he caused to be flayed alive in the
market place of the city. The skin of the wretched victim was
then stuffed: and with this ghastly trophy dangling from the
yard-arm of his galley, the brutal monster sailed back to Constantinople,
to receive the reward of his services from Selim
(son and successor of Solyman).”</p>

<p>Submit to that? Wait apathetically for the Turks to come
to Venice, Rome, Madrid and do in like manner? Well, no;
not in the real, whatever may be the ideal. What then? Why,
<em>Fight</em>.</p>

<p>Non-resistance: and if thine enemy smite thee upon the cheek,
turn to him the other also; and if he take thy coat give to
him also thy cloak; love your enemies; do good to them that
hate you and despitefully use you: and as result, what?
Crucifixion. A nation of Christs would be put to death as unjustly
as was the Christ of Calvary.</p>

<p>Fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;we know not which it may
prove to be&mdash;only the Tolstoyan few will carry to their logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
conclusions the principles of non-resistance; and few, if any,
even of the Tolstoyan few, will abide by these conclusions and
stand calm, kind, compassionate, even under the fatal final Injustice.
The great body of men, of today as of every other day
of the long ages of time, defend their rights; and if that defence
means that blood must flow,&mdash;then let it flow. And all
the more freely will blood flow and all the more sternly indomitable
will be the strife when men feel themselves justified
as they strike the blow; when they feel themselves called upon
to conquer or to die for a cause that they hold just; when
they fight elated and fortified with the assurance that they
stand as bulwarks warding off the concrete embodiment of all
that they hold evil from all that they hold dear and good.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“The bravest are the tenderest,</p>
<p class="verse4">The loving are the daring.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the bravest and the tenderest of men have trodden
knee deep in human blood. There have been wars just and
inevitable; and what has been may again be. We hope not;
we dream not; the Peace Palace of the Hague looms spectrally
on the future horizon; we are looking that way: and at times
this Peace Palace seems assertively real&mdash;ready to cope with
armaments and with red-hot wrongs; but again it rises fancifully
and floats evanescently away and fades on a gray sky.
Is it Mirage?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Christian Knight.</span></h3>

<p>Next in moral excellence to the Christian martyr is undoubtedly
the Christian knight.</p>

<p>Chivalry&mdash;fair flower of Feudalism, night blooming cereus
wide opening in white splendor exuding fragrance in somber
mediæval midnight! King Arthur and his Table Round;
knights errant done to death by Don Quixote and yet victors
even over the smile; Chevalier Bayard, the knight without fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and without reproach; Richard Cœur de Lion, the Black Prince,
Lohengren, Parsifal, Siegfried, Don John of Austria&mdash;are flowerets
of that Flower caught wax-white in amber and fixed
fadelessly.</p>

<p>In all the sweep of history from Egypt to the hour, there
is nothing nobler than the ideal Christian knight. To stand in
awe of the omnipotent God; to go about the world redressing human
wrongs; to love with young-world love bashfully reverent,
constrained to win the world and lay it humbly at <em>her</em> feet; to
reverence truth and to scorn with scorn unutterable all the
thousand and one manifestations of the lie; to be loyal to king
and country and God; to be gentle, courteous, kind to all life
from highest to lowest; to stand face-front to the oncoming
forces of evil and in that fight grimly to conquer or die: there
is nothing nobler.</p>

<p>And yet not for all the glory of Don <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'John, ideal Chirstian'">John, ideal Christian</ins>
knight and hero of Lepanto, would I have one little stain of
human blood on my white hands.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“New occasions teach new duties;</p>
<p class="verse">Time makes ancient good uncouth.”&mdash;<cite>Lowell.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>Nevertheless he who would sympathetically and justly depict
the past should be capable of entering into and all round estimating
that ancient good now grown uncouth. And whatever
the best men of any given age or time or clime unanimously
hold as best must, in the deep heart of things, be best for that
age or time or clime. The knight, the hero, the Crusader, the
victor over the Saracens seemed best to the best men of the
Middle Age.</p>

<p>Pope Pius V. earnestly advocated the cause of Venice. He
appealed to the Christian monarchs of Europe to join with the
Holy See in a League having for its object the total overthrow
of the Ottoman empire. He urged the aggressive policy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Turks under Solyman the Magnificent and his unworthy son
and successor Selim II.; he vividly portrayed the atrocities of
Turkish conquest and the blight upon civilization that ever unerringly
followed in the wake of the Crescent; and he endeavored
by all means in his power to arouse in the hearts of
the children of the Church the spirit that had made possible
the First Crusade.</p>

<p>All Europe at this time mourned its Christian captives who
were languishing in Turkish dungeons or wasting away as galley
slaves. Twelve thousand of these Christian captives were
chained to the oars as galley slaves on the Moslem ships while
the fight Lepanto was raging; their liberation and restoration
to freedom formed the purest joy-pearl in the gem casket of
that joyous victory.</p>

<p>Cyprus had just fallen into the hands of the Turks amid
scenes of unparalleled barbarity: and against the Turk as the
destroyer of civilization and the menace of Christendom all
eyes were directed, all hearts beat with desire to avenge, slay,
destroy: and all these feelings found outlet, and culmination
and gratification in the battle of Lepanto, under Don John of
Austria, the Christian knight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ocean Encounters.</span></h3>

<p>Ocean instability, ocean vastness, ocean majestic indifference
to the pigmy life and death struggles of men throw a magnetic
glow over sea fights.</p>

<p>When the bay of Salamis changed gradually from greenish
gray to red; when the Ionian sea slowly purpled off Actium,
crimsoning the frightened barge of Cleopatra and of love maddened
Anthony; when the waters at the entrance of the gulf
Lepanto grew blood-red fed by trickling streams from five hundred
galleys: did ocean care? The Titanic sinks and the billows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dash high in foam play, they descend sportively with her into
her grave hole, they arise and roll on: the Volturno blazes on
a background of black sky, a foreground of flame-lit angry
rolling waves: and does ocean care?</p>

<p>Don John arranged his battle line in a semi-circular stretch
of about one mile embracing the entrance to the gulf of Lepanto
(now Gulf Corinth). The Turkish fleet lay concealed somewhere
on the water of the gulf and must come out at the entrance
and fight openly or remain bottled up in the gulf until
forced out by starvation. Don John knew his adversary, Ali
Pasha, too well to dream that the latter alternative would be
accepted by the sturdy Moslem.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning (Oct. 7, 1571) Don John sighted a
line of ships far in the gulf but making steadily for the opening.
Battle was at hand. Don John, in his flagship, the Real, passed
from vessel to vessel encouraging and animating his soldiers.
“You have come,” he said, “to fight the battle of the Cross;
to conquer or to die. But whether you are to die or conquer,
do your duty this day and you will secure a glorious immortality.”
He then returned to his position in the center of the
semi-circle, and in that conspicuous position seen by all, he
knelt in prayer under the far floating banner of the League.
His example was followed by all, and the priests of whom there
was at least one if not more on each galley, went around giving
the last absolution to the men as they knelt in prayer.</p>

<p>The Ottoman shouts now filled the air as the long line of
three hundred galleys arranged as a crescent, paused for a moment
at the opening of the gulf. The center of the Christian
fleet following Don John advanced to the Ottoman center commanded
by Ali Pasha; the left wing under Barbarigo, the Venetian
admiral, sought as adversary the opposing wing under
Mahomet Sirocco; the right wing under Andrew Doria grappled
with the opposing Mohammedan left under Ulrich Ali, dey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of Algiers. For four hours the battle raged. So dense was the
canopy of smoke enveloping the combatants that neither side
knew for a certainty which was winning until the drawing
down of the Ottoman banner and the hasty hauling up of the
Banner of the League on board the flagship of Ali Pasha made
known the result decisively. Shouts then rent the air and
groans.</p>

<p>The Moslem left wing under the brave sea captain Ulrich
Ali was engaged in a fierce grappling fight with Doria, and the
advantage seemed to be with the Moslems. Don John seeing
this, hastened to Doria’s aid. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Ulich Ali, seeing'">Ulrich Ali, seeing</ins> that all was
lost, ordered his men at the oars to make all possible speed for
escape round the promontory. The Christian vessels gave chase,
but the Moslem galleys sped with the speed of the wind and
were soon lost to sight. About forty vessels were thus saved
out of the three hundred that had taken part in the engagement.
Of these one hundred and thirty <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'were siezed as'">were seized as</ins> prizes
by the Christian forces, the rest having been sunk or burned
in the fight.</p>

<p>The Ottoman loss is estimated between twenty-five thousand
and thirty thousand; that of the Christians at eight thousand.
The superior marksmanship of the allies and their use exclusively
of firearms, while the Turks used in part bows and
arrows; the better make and equipment of the Christian galleys&mdash;are
among the causes to which human reason may attribute the
incredible disparity between the Turkish loss and that of the
Christians in this engagement. But there are many circumstances
peculiar to this battle for which human reason can assign
no cause.</p>

<p>It is related on good authority that as the Christian soldiers
arose from prayer the wind which had hitherto been blowing
steadily from the gulf, suddenly veered around and blew right
into the faces of the enemy. In the course of the engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the sun, too, reached the point where its rays shot into
the eyes of the Turkish marksmen and caused them to err in
their aim. Pope Pius V. who, while the battle was in progress,
was closeted in consultation with a number of cardinals, in the
Vatican, suddenly arose from his seat and approaching the
window and casting up his eyes to the heavens exclaimed as
tears of joy rolled down his cheeks, “A truce to business; our
great task at present is to thank God for the victory He has
just given the Christians.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Death of Ali Pasha.</span></h3>

<p>The struggle between The Real, Don John’s flagship, and
the galley bearing Ali Pasha was of course pivotal. Each
commander felt that upon him and his ship depended the issue
of the combat. Both were brave men, both must conquer
or die: Don John conquered, Ali Pasha died.</p>

<p>The ships had grappled and a hand to hand conflict was
raging upon the decks. Blood slowly trickled down the sides
of the galleys and the waters were incarnadined.</p>

<p>In the heat of the engagement a musket ball struck the
head of the Moslem commander. He fell prone and lay for
some time unconscious upon a heap of the dying and the dead.
But suddenly regaining consciousness he attempted to rise and
was at once recognized by the surrounding Spanish soldiers.
They were about to despatch him with their swords when the
wily Moslem appealing to their natural cupidity made known
to them the secret hiding place of his ship’s treasure. The
lure of gold led the soldiers to hasten below leaving their victim
to chance life or death on the deck. But just as dear life
seemed secured from the ruthless thrust of death, the wounded
commander was confronted by a strangely savage figure with
uplifted sword. It was one of the Christian galley slaves long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
chained on Ali’s vessel and but that hour given freedom from
the hated oar. In vain did Ali Pasha appeal to this soldier’s
cupidity; nothing seemed quite so desirable to him as the death
of the man who had so long chained him a galley slave. The
threatening sword fell unerringly upon the wounded Moslem
chief and buried itself in his heart. With this retributive blow
the tide of victory turned decisively in favor of the Christians.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Don John of Austria.</span></h3>

<p>There are few characters upon the historic page more full
in promise and yet futile in attainment than Don John of
Austria. The idol of all Europe, the knight <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans peur et sans
reproche</i>, the hero of Lepanto&mdash;at the age of twenty-four; he
died seven years later in comparative obscurity; a rude hut
hastily erected to receive the dying commander served as his
last resting place upon earth.</p>

<p>As Don John lay in the agony of death, a terrific storm suddenly
broke over the camp; and as in the case of Napoleon
under somewhat <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'similar cricumstances'">similar circumstances</ins>, Don John partly arose,
muttered incoherently of battle and victory, then sank back
and died. Did the rattle of the storm suggest the din of battle?
Or did vague visions of another storm arise associatively in
memory? History relates that tho’ that battle Sunday, Oct. 7,
1571, was a day of ideal autumn brightness, yet when the strife
was fairly over and the battered galleys with their dead and
wounded and sorely wearied men were heavily entering port, a
storm suddenly arose: the skies darkened ominously, lightning
flashed from the lowering clouds, thunder reverberated, and
torrential rains poured down. For twenty-four hours the storm
continued. Was nature indignantly weeping over the errors
and sufferings of her children? Was she striving to wash out
from old ocean&mdash;the rugged, primal, favorite work of her hands&mdash;those
awful stains of blood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>As Don John had hastened to port under the gathering
storm he gave orders that the Moslem galleys rendered worthless
by the battle should be stripped of everything of value and
then set on fire. And so it was that when safe in port the
Christian conquerors looking out thro’ the storm saw the burning
ships. They luridly lit up the darkness and blazed wildly
down to the waves&mdash;mutely eloquent witnesses of the horror and
desolation of war.</p>

<p>Did the dulling senses of the hero of Lepanto see that scene,
hear that storm&mdash;as the winds raged round his temporary
shelter and death in blasting splendor closed over all? Or did
the fair “castles in Spain” rise again spectrally with light upon
them from beyond the grave as the dreamer of royal dreams
sank down to the real? That wonderful African empire so near,
so far: that beauteous bride, Mary Queen of Scots, liberated, released,
restored by his own good sword; wooed and won and
with her the throne of that imperious usurper Elizabeth Tudor:
that smile of pontiffs, that commendation of Catholic Europe,
that proud praise from the lips of his father’s son, Philip II.
of Spain&mdash;as he, the hero of Lepanto, the champion of Christendom,
returned fresh-laureled from new combats and victories, a
king, a crowned lover, an Emperor&mdash;Dreams!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p>Don John is buried in the Escorial. His name and fame
are inseparably associated with the decisive victory of the Cross
over the Crescent off the entrance to the gulf Lepanto.</p>

<p>An admirable painting of this battle <em>The Victory of the
League</em> by Titian still adorns the walls of the Museo, Madrid.</p>

<p>The petition <em>Mary, Help of Christians</em> inserted on this occasion
in the litany of Loretto bears evidence even today of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gratitude felt by Pius V. and with him all Christendom for deliverance
from the unspeakable Turk.</p>

<p>The historian Ranke speaking of the effects of this battle
says: “The Turks lost all their old confidence after the battle
of Lepanto. They had no equal to oppose to Don John of
Austria. The day of Lepanto broke down the Ottoman supremacy.”</p>

<span class="fs130">THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA</span></h2>


<p>Spain’s proudly invincible Armada left Lisbon, May 20,
1588 with one hundred and forty ships and thirty thousand
four hundred and ninety-seven men; fifty-three shattered vessels,
and ten thousand men, vincible and humbled, returned to
port Santander, Sept. 13, 1588. This disaster led to the decadence
of Spain <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'as a maritine'">as a maritime</ins> power, and indirectly to the decline
of Spanish dominance both in the old and in the new world.</p>

<p>The effects of any great event are not immediately discernible
nor are its causes ever fully revealed. When Philip II. of
Spain received with courteous equanimity his defeated admiral,
the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and to his words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse6">“And you see here, great King,</p>
<p class="verse">All that remains of the Armada’s might</p>
<p class="verse">And of the flower of Spain.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">made answer,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">“God rules above us!</p>
<p class="verse">I sent you to contend with men and not</p>
<p class="verse">With rocks and storms. You’re welcome to Madrid.”&mdash;<cite>Schiller.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">did the great King see then either the causes or the consequences
of the vincibility of his Invincible Armada!</p>

<p>The character of Philip II. is portrayed upon the historic
page in colors of sharp contrast. To the Spaniards he was
their Solomon, their “prudent king”; to Motley and the
Netherlands he was “the demon of the South.”</p>

<p>Philip II. was the finished product of his age and nation.
Pride, intolerance, absolutism combined with excellent administrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ability, deep tho’ narrow religious convictions, and rigorous
sincerity, characterized both the man and the monarch.
To a victim of an <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Auto da Fe</span> he said with stern truthfulness,
“If my own son were guilty like you I should lead him with
my own hands to the stake.”</p>

<p>As to Philip’s really having delivered his son, Don Carlos,
into the hands of the Grand Inquisitor as tragically told in
Schiller’s “Don Carlos”, well that is drama, not history. But
when a noted name and its suggested personality&mdash;for good or
for evil and unfortunately less frequently for good than for
evil&mdash;are once fascinatingly fixed in drama or story or song,
not all the tomes of contradictory evidence, not all the living
archives of dead centuries, not Truth itself, can shatter the
crystal charm or make it cease shining. Alexander the Great,
world conqueror; Socrates, the Wise; Plato, poet-philosopher;
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Artistotle, master'">Aristotle, master</ins> of them that know; Julius Cæsar, deplored of
all nations; Mark Anthony, Cleopatra’s lover; Nero, monster;
Caligula-Commodus-Heliogabalus, crowned madmen; Marcus
Aurelius, Emperor-philosopher; Charlemagne, the Good; Louis
IX., the Saint; Louis XI., hypocrite; John of England, child
murderer; Richard III., deformed devil; Henry VIII., wife-killer;
Machiavelli, serpent-sophist; Louis XIV., despot, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arbiter
Elegantiarum</i>; Elizabeth, Good Queen Bess; Mary, Queen of
Scots, the lovely unfortunate; Philip II. of Spain, bigot: thus
are they fixed in the charmed circle of literature and thus shall
they glitter forever.</p>

<p>Is history itself any more reliable than drama? As to facts,
Yes; as to motives, intentions, cumulative causes, results, all
round truth, No. “Histories are as perfect as the historian is
wise, and is gifted with an eye and a soul,” says the astute
Carlyle; and every honest author feels at deepest heart the
truth of these words. The soft art of omission is known to
every artist of the pen. And condemnation euphemistically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
balanced by excusing comment may, in one artistic sentence,
satisfy at once a writer’s conscience, his subjectivity, and the
claims of his peculiar environment. Can any one doubt that it
was thus Macaulay wrote his brilliant history of England? And
even granted almost the impossible&mdash;that an historian be ruggedly
truthful and fearlessly sincere; he is not thereby rendered
wise, nor is he necessarily gifted with an eye and a soul.</p>

<p>So in colors of sharp contrast upon the historic page will
Philip II. ever be portrayed; but both can’t be right. Perhaps
tho’ they may be as sundered extremes of a prismatic ray which,
when complementary coloring shall have been added, will become
white light.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Storms.</span></h3>

<p>Truly it was against storms and rocks as well as against
such rough sea-dogs as Drake and Hawkins and Raleigh and
Frobisher and Howard that the Invincible Armada contended.
In the beginning of the northward cruise as the Armada was
rounding the corner of Spain, off Corunna, a violent tempest
arose. The frail caravels, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'galeons and galeasses'">galleons and galleasses</ins> of 1588
were not so independent of wave and wind as are the Dreadnoughts
of 1914. Yet ocean is still master of man; and man’s
most titan-like Titanic is but a puny plaything in old Neptune’s
hand.</p>

<p>Several vessels were lost in the storm, and the fleet was
so badly damaged that in consequence the Spanish Admiral was
obliged to stop off at Corunna for repairs. July 12th, after
so inauspicious a beginning, the fleet was again on its way northward.</p>

<p>Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, captain general of all
the Spanish armies, was at Dunkirk with a flotilla of large flat-bottomed
barges awaiting the Armada to convoy him and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
army across the channel. His plan was to invade England by
way of the Thames and land his veteran forces in London.</p>

<p>“Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma, captain general of
the Spanish armies, and governor of the Spanish possessions
in the Netherlands, was beyond all comparison the greatest
military genius of his age. He was also highly distinguished
for political wisdom and sagacity, and for his great administrative
talents. He was idolized by his troops, whose affection he
knew how to win without relaxing their discipline or diminishing
his own authority. Pre-eminently cool and circumspect in
his plans, but swift and energetic when the moment arrived for
striking a decisive blow, neglecting no risk that caution could
provide against, conciliating even the populations of the districts
which he attacked by his scrupulous good faith; his moderation,
and his address; Farnese was one of the most formidable generals
that ever could be placed at the head of an army designed
not only to win battles, but to effect conquests. Happy it is
for England and the world that this island was saved from becoming
an arena for the exhibition of his powers.” Creasy.</p>

<p>As in 1588 Alexander Farnese with a chosen army awaited at
Dunkirk the assistance of the Armada both to clear the seas
of Dutch and English war ships and to convoy in safety his
flotilla to the coast of England: so, too, in 1805 Napoleon Bonaparte
awaited at Boulogne for Villeneuve to do him a like service;
and in both cases the English fleet took the offensive and
destroyed at one blow both the protective war boats of the enemy
and the hopeful plans of the man who waited. The sea fights
at Calais Roads and at Trafalgar are perhaps negatively momentous
in history but not the less momentous.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet after some disastrous fighting with the
English cruisers off the coast of Plymouth succeeded in reaching
Calais Roads (July 27). Here they were quickly semi-circled
by the combined Dutch and English fleet under Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Charles Howard, high admiral of England. The Spanish ships
were far greater in bulk than those of the opposing force and in
the harbor of Calais they were huddled together “like strong
castles fearing no assault, the lesser placed in the middle ward.”
The lighter English ships, no longer able to use their two best
assets, nimbleness and advantage of the wind, clung doggedly
around these ocean leviathans awaiting the hour of opportunity.
At length early on the morning of the 29th the English Admiral
succeeded in thrusting eight Greek fire-ships in among
the compact wooden war vessels. The effect was electrical. The
Spanish ships cut their cables and were dispersed and the fight
ship to ship was soon in full progress. All day long from early
dawn till dark this battle raged. The Spaniards were driven
out from Calais Roads and past the Flemish ports and far out
beyond Dunkirk where the Prince of Parma waited. The English
then ceased pursuit. Lord Henry Seymour with an able
squadron was left to maintain the blockade of the Flemish port
and to render ineffectual the activities of the Prince of Parma.</p>

<p>Northward sped the vincible Armada farther and farther
from sunny Spain. She had many wounded men on board
ships, her provisions were failing, the channel filled with victorious
Dutch and English war boats offered no hope of a way of
return, and at last in desperation the Spanish admiral directed
the course of his ships around the northern coast of Scotland
and Ireland. What a long and cruel way home for wounded
soldiers, starving sailors, and disheartened generals! But even
here ill luck pursued them. A storm arose as they were passing
thro’ the Orkneys; their vessels were dispersed, many were
lost. About thirty ships were afterwards wrecked on the west
coast of Ireland, and those of the crews who succeeded in reaching
the shore were immediately put to death. It is estimated
that fourteen thousand thus perished.</p>

<p>And in September of that memorable year there came straggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ship by ship into the port Santander all that were
left of the gallant fleet that had sailed away five months ago
to subdue England and so win all Europe for Spain.</p>

<p>Nor was that plan at all chimerical, nor its realization improbable.
Spain was at that time in possession of Portugal,
Naples, Sicily, Milan, Franche-Compte, and the Netherlands; in
Africa she controlled Tunis, Oran, the Cape Verde and the
Canary islands; in Asia, the Philippine and Sunda Islands and
part of the Moluccas; in the New World, the empire of Peru,
and of Mexico, New Spain, Chili, Hispaniola and Cuba. Only
England held out against the power of Spain and stood adamantine
to all her threats, cajolery, caresses. Only England stood
between Philip II. of Spain and Spanish dominance in the old
and in the New World. English <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'buccanneers siezed upon his galeons'">

Drake the “master robber of the New World” had signally dishonored
Philip of Spain and had in requital been honored by
the English queen with the title <em>Sir Francis</em>. England must be
destroyed (Britannia delenda est.) Spain seemed powerful
enough by land and by sea to be as a new Rome to old Carthage:
but winds and waves and rocky coasts and adamantine Englishmen
reversed the Roman story (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannia non deleta est</span>.)</p>

<p>These lines upon the lips of Elizabeth Tudor are her condemnation

<p>Elizabeth would have Mary Stuart put to death, but would

so regretfully, to have recalled the fatal sentence when, alas!
too late. But all this flimsy Seeming has been blown away by
the rugged years; and that which this <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Macchiavellian queen'">Machiavellian queen</ins>
thought subject to the judgment of no man has become her condemnation
in the eyes of all.</p>

<p>So close they lie together now in old Westminster Abbey&mdash;these
rival queens who once so cordially feared and hated one
another! and for whose conflicting ambitions all Britain was not
room enough, but one must die! How ignoble seems now the
strife, how despicable the deed of culminant hate, how diaphanous
all the Seeming! Was it worth while?</p>

<p>The death of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the hands of her
cousin Queen Elizabeth aroused a feeling of angry indignation
in every court of Europe. France, Spain, and the Vatican,
openly denounced the deed. And it was, in great measure, in
execration of this unnatural cruelty that Pope Sextus V. espoused
the cause of Philip II. of Spain and urged and aided the invasion
of England.</p>

<p>Strange that such men as Edmund Spenser, author of
<cite>Færie Queen</cite> and Sir Walter Raleigh, mirror of chivalry, should
have been among the foremost to demand the death of the Scottish
queen. But those were turbulent times. Life and death
never played the mortal game more boldly and recklessly and
desperately than in the sixteenth century. The magic of the
New World was upon the old; the glamour of gem-lit El
Dorados shimmered across the seas; and thither responsively
rushed in shaky ships and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'leaky caravals'">leaky caravels</ins> those whom the gods
would destroy made mad by the bite of the gold-tarantula. “We
are as near to heaven by sea as by land”, shouted Sir Humphrey
Gilbert as his frail bark was lost in the storm; as his deck lights
rose high and dashed low and darkened far down ’neath the sea-lashing
storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>And night with wondering stars looked down upon De Soto’s
lordly grave. And then as now and even throughout the historic
ages, the prehistoric, the geologic&mdash;the thundering waters
fell and formed Niagara Falls. In silvery moonlight, in dazzling
sun-radiance rainbow-frilled, in blinding white of winter, in
rainy spring, in saber flashing summer storm&mdash;the thunder-waters
fell; they fall; they shall fall.</p>

<p>When Columbus and his crew, secretly fearful of falling
off the good old planet Earth, sailed the unknown sea; while
Cortes conquered Mexico (not yet calm); while Pizarro ravaged
Peru; while Balboa ascended the Andean heights and “silent
upon a peak in Darien” first saw the vast Pacific; while De Soto
died and was buried; while Drake circumnavigated the globe;
while Mary, Queen of Scots laid her head on the block and the
axe fell; while the Invincible Armada hurrying northward away
from the foe, sailed brokenly back to Spain by way of the
Orkneys: while Julius Cæsar fell pierced with twenty-three
wounds; while Hannibal crossed the Alps; while Alexander,
world-conqueror, aged thirty-two died at old Babylon; while
Pericles of Athens reigned imperishably; while Sardis burned
and Sardis was avenged; while Marathon, Salamis, Thermopylæ,
Platæa, Mycale were fighting; while Babylon the Great was captured
by Cyrus; while the Memphian pyramids were building;
while the great Sphinx of Gizeh rose solemnly; while griffins and
dragons and gummy pterodactyls winged the air; while
plesiosauri and ichthyosauri fought for the empire of ocean;
while the original of the Pittsburgh Diplodocus Carnegiei was
sixty feet somewhere&mdash;why, even then were the waters rolling
over the rock now called Niagara; even then Niagara Falls that
fall and shall fall were falling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sea Fights.</span></h3>

<p>The hostile encounters by land throughout the historic ages
have been practically countless; sea fights are few. Man feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
intuitively that the yielding wave is not the fit place for battle.
Salamis, Actium, Lepanto, Calais Roads are the chief naval engagements
of history.</p>

<p>When Rome had won her first game in world conquest and
all Italy was Rome, Carthage was mistress of the Mediterranean,
and without her permission no man might even wash his
hands in her “Phœnician Lake.” Triremes and quinqueremes
with proudly curving prows scudded over the blue waters or
huddled together in port as bevies of black swans.</p>

<p>And Rome had no fleet. But Rome could learn from her
enemies; and when a wrecked Carthaginian galley was dashed
against the Latian coast, Rome quickly learned the art of making
galleys; and within two months the waving forest near the
coast was metamorphosed into a fleet of one hundred and twenty
Roman triremes.</p>

<p>And when the pain of growth was upon Rome making
further conquest fatally necessary, she embarked unsteadily upon
her late waving forest trees and went reeling forth to meet
the swan bevies of the Mediterranean. The hostile fleets engaged
and Rome’s was annihilated.</p>

<p>Then these sullen young-world children wildly wept, as did
Romulus and Remus, perhaps, in the cave of the she-wolf. But
when they were suckled and made strong with the milk of defeat,
these wild young Romans built themselves another fleet.
And Duillius devised a grappling contrivance whereby to catch
and hold the enemy’s ship until a drawbridge could be thrown
across o’er which the short-sword Roman soldiers might pass
and so fight on the deck hand to hand as on land.</p>

<p>Again the hostile fleets engaged on the blue Mediterranean.
But as the haughty quinqueremes with their decks filled
with archers bore down upon the awkward Roman triremes, the
grappling “hands” arose, the quinqueremes were grappled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Consternation prevailed among the Carthaginians as the drawbridges
from ship to ship were thrown across, and the dreaded
Roman soldiers short-sword in hand were seen slaughtering the
archers and the rowers. Rome’s first naval victory was won.</p>

<p>If the blue Mediterranean could make known all that has
taken place upon its waves and shores&mdash;what a Homer of the
waters it would be! But nature is indifferent to the human
tragedy.</p>

<p>That other scene off the coast of Carthage, after the second
Punic war, when Rome demanded as a condition of peace that
the Carthaginian fleet should be destroyed&mdash;yet burns upon
the historic page, but the waters that once reddened with the
flames just ripple unrememberingly. Five hundred galleys&mdash;towering
quinqueremes, sturdy triremes&mdash;were led out from the
harbor before the mourning gaze of the dethroned Queen of the
Seas, and set on fire; she watched them blaze down to the
laughing waters.</p>

<p>Actium was fought on the Adriatic off the promontory on the
west coast of Greece. Here half the world was bartered for one
fleeing galley and one woman. While the conflict was yet
doubtful and victory seemed even favorably inclined to perch
upon the prow of Anthony’s vessel, the barge of Cleopatra shudderingly
backed out from the bloody fray, wavered, turned, and
sped southward. Marc Anthony followed. Upon the defeat
of the allied Roman and Egyptian forces at Actium and over
the tragically dead forms of Anthony and Cleopatra, Octavius
Cæsar arose to world dominance, becoming Augustus Cæsar,
Emperor, Pater Patriæ, and one man Ruler of Rome, Mistress
of the world.</p>

<p>Lepanto was fought at the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth,
not far from Actium. Here the Cross triumphed over the
Crescent and rescued Europe from the deadly blight of Islamism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Don John of Austria, aged twenty-four, led the Christian
forces; Alexander Farnese (Prince of Parma), then a youth of
twenty, won here his first of many laurels under the generously
approving eyes of his young cousin-commander, Don
John.</p>

<p>And seventeen years later (1571-1588) the Prince of Parma,
Captain general of all the Spanish armies, awaited impatiently
at Dunkirk for Admiral Medina Sidonia to clear the channel
of hostile vessels so that he and his veteran army might sail
across and attack old England. He watched the fight off
Gravelines. How his hot Spanish heart must have indignantly
throbbed even to bursting, as helplessly cooped in port with a
flotilla of unarmed barges to protect, and Lord Seymour with a
strong blockading squadron at the mouth of the harbor, he could
only see and know and acutely feel that a fearful battle was raging
all day long from dawn till dark and that Spain was losing&mdash;Spain
had lost. One by one hurrying northward past the
Flemish ports limped the disabled Spanish ships; English and
Dutch cruisers followed in fierce pursuit.</p>

<p>The invasion of England by way of the Thames, the conquest
of an inveterate foe, Success proudly placing a flaming
carbuncle upon the coronet of the Prince of Parma, the approving
glance of Philip and of the fair girl-queen Isabella, Spanish
dominance in the old and in the new world&mdash;all as burst bubbles
died down in gray mist as twilight descended, as dark night
gathered over the wave and the world and the fleeing scattered
shattered ships of Spain’s vincible Armada.</p>

<span class="fs130">NASEBY</span></h2>


<p>The battle of Naseby was, perhaps, the anticipative preventive
of an English “French Revolution.” The difference between
Cromwell’s Ironsides and the gay Frondeurs measures the
difference between the English people and the French.</p>

<p>Charles I. aimed to be in England what Louis XIV. was in
France. Both fully believed in the divine right of Kings; both
quoted as their favorite text of Scripture, “Where the word of
a King is there is power; and who may say unto him ‘What
doest thou?’” But Louis dealt with the fickle Frondeurs and
Charles with Cromwell’s Ironsides; and this racial difference had
as divergent results&mdash;absolutism for Louis le Grand and the
block for Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>There will always be difference of opinion as to Cromwell’s
place in history. Was he liberator or tyrant, Christian ruler or
barbarously fanatic despot? There can be but one opinion
as to the injustice of the trial, condemnation, and death of
Charles. The Rump Parliament was certainly not representative
of England. It was Cromwell’s creature as arbitrarily as ever
the Star Chamber was Charles’.</p>

<p>“Must crimes be punished but by other crimes, and greater
criminals?”&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>But as a force in favor of constitutional government and
civic liberty, however abused in immediate practice; and as a
threatening protest against the abuse of power in high places;
and as a veiled challenge of defiance to every absolute monarch&mdash;the
battle fought June 14, 1645, at Naseby, Northamptonshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
between the Royalists under Charles I. and the Parliamentarians
under Fairfax must ever be considered a victory decisive and
for all time advantageous.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen Henrietta Maria.</span></h3>

<p>Henrietta Maria was the daughter of Henry IV. of France,
the first Bourbon, and his second wife, Maria de Medici. At
the age of fifteen she was married to Charles I. of England; and
her best and happiest years as wife, mother, and Queen were
spent in England.</p>

<p>In this princess many of the leading Italian, French and
English characteristics were met and happily blended. Her
dark, lithe beauty (as shown in her portrait by Van Dyke), her
musical ability, instrumental and vocal, her fiery-hearted fidelity
to the religion of her mother, were, perhaps, her heritage from
sunny Italy; the France of Richelieu might, as an environment,
conduce favorably to that diplomatic waywardness which, in
early years, invariably won for the sweet girl-wife whatsoever
her heart might desire; but perhaps from England, land of
realism, chilly fogs, and Cromwellian barbarity, she imbibed her
sturdy spirit of fortitude and heroic endurance of sorrow.</p>

<p>“To bear is to conquer our fate”, and to refuse to bear and
to apparently end all by self-destruction, is to fail to conquer
our fate.</p>

<p>The hopes and promises of religion are of inestimable value
as an aid in the endurance of sorrows. When the dread culmination
of all earthly fears and horrors&mdash;the beheading of
Charles I.&mdash;clashed full upon the widowed heart of Queen Henrietta
Maria, she withdrew at once from the court of Paris and
sought solace in seclusion and prayer. The convent, not the
court; the divine, not the human; the hopes and promises of religion
as red-glowed in the sanctuary of a Carmelite convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
chapel, held the balm that soothed her wounded soul in that
awful culminant woe.</p>

<p>Which is better&mdash;to bear or to fail to bear? to hope and endure
or despair and die? to pray and bless God saying, <em>The Lord
gave and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the
Lord</em>, or to wither away in cursing and impotent hate? to believe
and grow strongly peaceful in the belief that God is good
and all is for the best; that all is little and short that passes
away with time; that God’s explanation shall exultingly explain
forever and ever&mdash;or to doubt, negative, deny, and bitterly
live and despairingly die? Even as a matter of merely human
wisdom, it is well to believe in the hopes and promises of religion.</p>

<p>The monastic sanctuaries that arise wherever the Catholic
Church flourishes, and that lure into their prayerful solitudes
the “hearts that are heavy with losses and weary with dragging
the crosses too heavy for mortals to bear” are surely indicative
of a far higher and happier state of society than that whose
godless defiance finds suicidal expression in the insidious drug,
the deadly acid, the desperate bullet.</p>

<p>The houses of Euthanasia of the near Socialistic future are
surely as stones unto bread in comparison with the monastic
sanctuaries of the Middle Ages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wonders of Portraits.</span></h3>

<p>How wonderful is the art which can impress upon canvas
and so preserve from generation to generation and from century
to century, a lifelike presentment of men and women whose flesh
and blood realities have long since mouldered dust with dust!
The canvas endures; the man dies?&mdash;Ah, no! he has but shuffled
off the earth-garment and left it earth with earth; he lives.</p>

<p>The Van Dyke portraits of Queen Henrietta Maria, Charles I.
and the children of Charles I. are mutely eloquent. The well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
picture, “Baby Stuart”, a detail from the group, “Children
of Charles I.” suggests the high tide of love and happiness
in the life of Queen Henrietta Maria. She was then
surrounded by everything that heart could desire,&mdash;wealth,
honor, power, a husband’s unbounded love and confidence and
three beautiful and most promising children. They were Mary,
who later married William, Prince of Orange; Charles, who, at
the Restoration, became the “Merry Monarch” of England, and
James, the baby Stuart, who later became the unfortunate
James II., the monarch who lost his crown, and whose daughter
Mary, wedded to her cousin, William, Prince of Orange, son of
that sister Mary, who, in the portrait, stands at <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'his side, abbetted'">his side, abetted</ins>
the deposition of her father and wore his crown.</p>

<p>There is something eloquently pathetic in the portraits of
men and women who have fallen victims to a tragic fate. The
principle of contrast is, doubtless, here at work, setting side by
side with the hour of portrayal that other hour of bitter death.
Marie Antoinette and her children, as fixed upon canvas by
the court painter, Madame Vigee LeBrun, derive their rich tonal
qualities&mdash;warm grays and reds, their charm of evanescence,
their magically somber fascination, from the shadows of the
Conciergerie and the guillotine.</p>

<p>The portrait of Charles I. as painted by Van Dyke, must ever
suggest to the thoughtful student of history that scene, disgraceful
alike to the English nation and to human nature which took
place on the scaffold just outside Whitehall Palace.</p>

<p>Yes; there are two sides to every question, and one is a ruler
exercising arbitrary power and impregnated with belief in the
divine right of kings and claiming it his prerogative to break
up his parliament and govern alone; the other is an assembly
of men, nominally a parliament, so narrowly fanatic and steeped
in human hate that they demanded as condition under which
they would agree to levy taxes for Charles I. to use in aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Protestant Holland, that he should first order every Catholic
priest in his own realm to be put to death and the property of
all Catholics to be confiscated. Charles refused. This side of
the cause of the rupture between Charles I. and his Parliament
has not the historic prominence of the other side. Why?
Not very hard to tell <em>why</em> if one considers attentively the writers
of the history of that period.</p>

<p>“I hope to meet my end with calmness. Do not let us speak
of the men into whose hands I have fallen. They thirst for my
blood, they shall have it. God’s will be done, I give Him
thanks. I forgive them all sincerely, but let us say no more
about them”&mdash;these words addressed to Bishop Juxon by
Charles a few days before his death attest the inherent nobility
of his nature. Whatever the life of Charles I. may have
been, his death was kingly; and if death is the echo of life
then, too, his life must have been vocal with virtues. But what
virtue can outshine or even illumine the black chaos of creed-fanaticism,
odium, obloquy? What power can break up and
restore to their original settings the half-truths, untruths, errors
and lies glitteringly crystalized in history, drama, story and
song? Does time right ancient wrongs, readjust and make-whole
torn, century-scattered truths? We dream so; we say
so; but at deepest heart we whisper <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>With unruffled calmness, with dignity, with kingly grace,
Charles I. stepped from the opening of what had been in happier
days his banqueting hall and advanced upon the scaffold.
In the words of Agnes Strickland:</p>

<p>“It was past 1 o’clock before the grisly attendants and
apparatus of the scaffold were ready. Colonel Hacker led the
king through his former banqueting hall, one of the windows of
which had originally been contrived to support stands for public
pageantries; it had been taken out and led to the platform
raised in the street. The noble bearing of the King as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
stepped on the scaffold, his beaming eyes and high expression,
were noticed by all who saw him. He looked on all sides for
his people, but dense masses of soldiery only presented themselves
far and near. He was out of hearing of any persons but
Juxon and Herbert, save those who were interested in his destruction.
The soldiers preserved a dead silence; this time
they did not insult him. The distant populace wept, and occasionally
raised mournful cries in blessings and prayers for
him. The king uttered a short speech, to point out that every
institute of the original constitution of England had been subverted
with the sovereign power. While he was speaking someone
touched the axe, which was laid enveloped in black crepe
on the block. The king turned round hastily and exclaimed,
‘Have a care of the axe. If the edge is spoiled it will be the
worse for me.’</p>

<p>“The king put up his flowing hair under a cap; then, turning
to the executor asked, ‘Is any of my hair in the way?’ ‘I
beg your majesty to push it more under your cap,’ replied the
man, bowing. The bishop assisted his royal master to do so and
observed to him: ‘There is but one stage more, which, though
turbulent and troublesome, is yet a very short one. Consider, it
will carry you a great way&mdash;even from earth to heaven.’ ‘I
go,’ replied the king, ‘from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown.’</p>

<p>“He unfastened his cloak and took off the medallion of the
order of the Garter. The latter he gave to Juxon, saying with
emphasis, ‘Remember!’ Beneath the medallion of St. George was
a secret spring which removed a plate ornamented with lilies,
under which was a beautiful miniature of his Henrietta. The
warning word, which has caused many historical surmises, evidently
referred to the fact that he only had parted with the
portrait of his beloved wife at the last moment of his existence.
He then took off his coat and put on his cloak, and pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the block, said to the executioner: ‘Place it so that it will not
shake.’ ‘It is firm, sir,’ replied the man. ‘I shall say a short
prayer,’ said the king, ‘and when I hold out my hand thus,
strike.’ The king stood in profound meditation, said a few
words to himself, looked upward on the heavens, then knelt and
laid his head on the block. In about a minute he stretched
out his hands, and his head was severed at one blow.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sorrow.</span></h3>

<p>News travelled slowly in the days of long ago; and the trial,
death and burial of Charles I. were over long before intelligence
of the dire happenings in England had been carried into
France. Queen Henrietta Maria, then in the Louvre Palace,
Paris, had just received into her motherly arms her second son,
James, who had successfully passed through the belligerent
lines and reached safety in Paris. This joy was soon dulled
into woe.</p>

<p>Ominous whispers among the Louvre circle and pitying
glances caused the queen to make inquiries. The worst was soon
told. The queen had expected imprisonment, perhaps even
deposition and exile, but death, the official beheading of an
English sovereign&mdash;had not once entered into her mind as
among the possibilities. The queen sat silent and tearless
among her sympathizing English attendants. Pere Gamache
approached. She received him apathetically. Her aunt, the
Duchess de Vendome, took her hand and held it caressingly&mdash;but
the Queen seemed in a state of frozen woe; no moan, no sigh,
no tear. Pere Gamache withdrew unobserved and searching
through the royal chambers he found the little Princess Henriette,
the four-year-old idol of the once happy Stuart home.
Leading the child gently by the hand, he returned to the scene
of grief.</p>

<p>At the touch of baby hands, the impress of childish kisses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the unhappy Queen seemed slowly to come back to life even
as it was, and clasping her little daughter in rapturous tenderness
to her breast she wept. Long and wildly she wept and the
frightened child weeping responsively and clinging helplessly to
her bosom saved her at last to sanity and to heroic endurance.</p>

<p>Tennyson has beautifully expressed this power of childish love
and helplessness to save a mother from despair:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Home they brought her warrior dead;</p>
<p class="verse4">She nor swoon’d, nor utter’d cry,</p>

<p class="verse4">“She must weep or she will die.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Then they praised him, soft and low,</p>
<p class="verse4">Called him worthy to be loved,</p>

<p class="verse4">Yet she neither spoke nor moved.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Stole a maiden from her place,</p>
<p class="verse4">Lightly to the warrior stept</p>
<p class="verse">Took the face-cloth from his face;</p>
<p class="verse4">Yet she neither moved nor wept.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Rose a nurse of ninety years,</p>
<p class="verse4">Set his child upon her knee&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Like summer tempest came her tears&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse4">“Sweet my child, I live for thee.”</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>A few days later the Queen withdrew from the French court
for a brief period of retirement and prayer in the Carmelite
Convent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milton.</span></h3>

<p>While the drama in high places was playing before the
world, a more enduring side scene was enacting in a quiet
English home. John Milton, in political disgrace, in sorrow of
soul, and in total blindness was dictating to his daughters the
lines of “Paradise Lost.” Cromwell and his Roundheads, the
Merry Monarch and his dissolute court, James II. and his sorrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
passed away; the visions seen by the blind old bard
remain.</p>

<p>As literary immortality is the highest prize that fate holds
for mortals it is fitting that the cost of attainment should be
proportionately high. And in this adjustment fate is inexorable.
Heart’s blood and tears wrought into a book give it enduring
qualities: much, much; little, little; some, some; none, none.
The dictum of Horace in the olden day, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si vis me flere</i>, etc., is
still the exponent of an author’s power.</p>

<p>That poem by Mrs. Browning, “A Musical Instrument,” has
fixed in rainbow evanescence&mdash;a Thoughts’ Niagara Bridal Veil&mdash;ten
thousand blending, blinding truths and beauties that prose
could never hold or catch.</p>

<p>Is the prize worth the price? In itself, No; but in the
soul-growth that its mastery implies and in the soul-wealth that
it makes one’s own forever and ever, Yes. Then, too, they to
whom Fame shines as an ever luring star, urging on, on, incessantly
even through blood and tears, are so formed by their
fate that the prize seems to them worth while; its winning seems
life’s only good, its loss, life’s supreme sorrow. “The attractions
are proportional to the destinies.”</p>

<p>So who shall judge his unknown neighbor? Who shall justly
say, <em>Thou fool</em> to the man who must needs follow his fate?
Who shall justly pity him whose poverty, disgrace, bitterness
of heart, and blindness of soul and body&mdash;lead to the star-luring
heights of literary immortality?</p>

<p>Milton was Latin secretary under Oliver Cromwell and a
man of great influence at the court. He shared in the amnesty
proclaimed by Charles II. at the Restoration. Milton’s remaining
years were spent in retirement and literary labors.</p>

<p>The return of the Stuarts shattered all his hopes, religious
and political. He seemed to see in the Stuart restoration the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
first gathering gloom of a darkness which should overwhelm himself,
England, and all the earth. Subjectively this was true.
Milton never saw beyond that gathering cloud; and when the
culminant blackness of his own blindness closed in upon him,
then, too, into a common gloom sank Milton, England and all
the earth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“And darkness shows us worlds by night</p>
<p class="verse4">We never see by day.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Would Paradise Lost have been born into literature if Milton
had not become blind?</p>

<p>Would we of today find congenial that Milton of the old
Puritanical day? Do we admire the Miltonic God? Milton
liked best his Lucifer, and that liking elusively throbs through
Paradise Lost and elicits response.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charles II.</span></h3>

<p>There must have been a great measure of compensation to
Charles I. in the filial devotion of his household. It is related
that Prince Charles, eldest son, and heir apparent to the throne,
sent to his father, when in prison, a document <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>
signed with his name. And in a letter enclosed the Prince assured
his father that whatever conditions he should see fit to
make with Cromwell and his followers relative to the succession
would be agreeable to him, in token whereof he had signed his
name to the document. There was something heroic in that, and
something even more magnanimously heroic in the response of
Charles I. He at once tore the document to pieces, fearing that
the enemy might get possession of it and make use of it against
Prince Charles. He wrote tenderly to his son, admitting the
pleasure his generous offer had given, but declaring that death
would be preferable to any act whereby the rights of his children
should be tampered with or signed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to note these nobler actions and emotions in the
lives of kings: the ambitious selfishness and cruelty of a Macbeth,
a King John, a Richard III. are pedestaled for all the
world to see; why not the mutual magnanimity of the Stuarts?
Truly the evil that men do lives after them, the good is oftimes
interred with their bones.</p>

<p>At the death of Cromwell, after a five years’ stormy reign
as Lord Protector of England, and after a twelve years’ exile of
the family of Charles I., the people of England unanimously welcomed
the restoration of the Stuarts. Charles II.&mdash;known in
France under this title since the death of Charles I.&mdash;was
crowned King of England.</p>

<p>The times were troubled. Roundhead and Cavalier still stood
at misunderstanding <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'enimity one'">enmity one</ins> directly opposed to the other
and never the twain might meet. The pendulum swung with
bewildering rapidity from harshly somber Cromwellian Puritanism
to the excessive dissipation of the Court of the Merry
Monarch: the country followed the pendulum.</p>

<p>Charles II., while humane on the whole, and more inclined
to ease and pleasure than to troublesome revenge, yet displayed
a touch of the savage in his treatment of the body of Oliver
Cromwell. He ordered that it be disinterred and the head struck
off. This was done; and the ghastly head of the man who had
ruled England with a rod of iron for five years, was fastened
to the gibbet at Tyburn.</p>

<p>Horrible is the hate which pursues its victim beyond death
and wreaks vengeance upon an unresisting mass of putrefaction!
All such excesses, no matter by whom committed or
under what provocation, are atavistic expressions of the jackal
and the tiger in the heart of man.</p>

<p>Truly there is no eye that can foresee the future! Cromwell,
passing for the thousandth time through the thoroughfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Tyburn, saw not there his own head fastened to a gibbet.
Charles I., at the stately banquet board of Whitehall Palace,
saw not the great end window of the hall opening upon the
scaffold. And we, secure in the hour, see not that other hour
of fatal import that yet shall be; and&mdash;’tis well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Death of Queen Henrietta.</span></h3>

<p>Queen Henrietta Maria was not present at the scenes of acclamation
which welcomed the return of her son, Charles II.
She was at that time happily absorbed in the forth-coming marriage
of her charming daughter, the Princess Henriette Maria,
to Philip, Duke of Orleans, brother of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Some time later Queen Henrietta Maria went to England.
She resided there three years, but her heart’s best interests were
in sunny France where her idolized daughter, the Duchess of
Orleans, moved amid the gay court of Versailles as its chief
honor and ornament. Charles II. and his wife, Catherine, of
Braganza, reluctantly bade farewell to the Queen-mother after
accompanying her as far as the Nore; but doubtless there was
secret joy in the heart of Henrietta Maria as the foggy shores
of England receded from view and France arose in expectancy.</p>

<p>Then, too, all seemed calm in England; Charles II. and his
wife were high in popular favor. Her second son, James, Duke
of York, was happily married and surrounded by a promising
family. James’ eldest daughter, the Lady Mary, later Queen
Mary II. of England, was a great favorite with the affectionate
grandmother, Henrietta Maria. Anne, James’ second daughter,
afterward Queen Anne of England, was also attached to the
kindly old Queen-mother.</p>

<p>The old-age years of Henrietta Maria rolled on in comparative
happiness. Some lives seem to have their sorrows
scattered uniformly over the years, a gentle drizzle, never dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sunlight; other lives are marked by dynamic contrasts&mdash;brilliancy,
ecstatic light suddenly blackened by tornado blasts
and torn by lurid lightning, and after that, calm again and
even the bright light.</p>

<p>Queen Henrietta Maria’s tornado blast and searing lightning
flash came full upon her when her husband was beheaded; her
later years were calmly happy. In philanthropic labors, in the
exercise of all the gentle charities of the Christian heart, in the
hopeful fulfilment of religious obligations, the old age years
drifted calmly to the great Calm.</p>

<p>It chanced that at that time the use of opium as a sedative,
narcotic, and harmless medicine was in vogue at the court. M.
Valot, favorite physician of Louis XIV., ordered it for the
Queen. In the best of spirits and laughing at the supposed
wonderful qualities of the new panacea, Henrietta Maria took
the prescribed drug. An hour later she fell into a peaceful
slumber; the night passed and the day passed, and still she
slept. Alarm was felt, her son-in-law, the Duke of Orleans, was
soon at her bedside; the little granddaughter, Anne, was brought
near in hopes of arousing the dormant sensibilities&mdash;but in vain.
Queen Henrietta had sunk into the calm; it was too good to
leave; she stayed, sank deeper, deeper, and with a little sigh of
relief she died.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bossuet’s Sermon.</span></h3>

<p>Jacques Benigne Bossuet, the eloquent pulpit orator of the
court of Louis XIV., added a classic to French literature in his
masterly discourse at the obsequies of Henrietta Maria. It was
delivered in the convent chapel of the nuns of the Visitation of
Chaillot, whom the late Queen particularly favored, and for
whom she had founded the convent.</p>

<p>The nobility of France were gathered together on this occasion,
the “most illustrious assembly of the world” sat spell-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
under the eloquence of the “Eagle of Meaux.” Bossuet
had proved equal to his opportunity.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, Bossuet is better known today by that other
funeral oration delivered some months later at the obsequies of
Queen Henrietta Maria’s youngest daughter, Henriette of England,
Duchess of Orleans.</p>

<p>When the old die, well&mdash;there can be no Shelleyan lamentation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Grief made the young Spring wild,</p>
<p class="verse">And she threw down her opening buds</p>
<p class="verse">As if she autumn were and they dead leaves.”</p>
<p class="verse16">&mdash;<cite>Shelley.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The young spring may, indeed, thus lavishly lament for the
young, but not for the old. When a poet Keats, aged twenty-six,
lies brokenheartedly and beautifully dead; when a queenly woman,
wife and bereaved mother, aged twenty-eight, lies pathetically
dead&mdash;oh, then, all that Shelley may poetically declare, all
that Bossuet may magically proclaim, seem fitting and just and
true. We understand the young Spring tantrums; and the sobbings
of the buds as roughly sundered from the grief-swept trees,
seem strangely familiar, as though ages ago we ourselves had
thus wildly wept when the world was young.</p>

<p>Wealth, station, honor, health, happiness, youth, beauty, love&mdash;today;
and the tomb tomorrow! This contrast has ever most
forcefully appealed to the human heart. Bossuet knew full well
the force of this appeal and again the orator and the occasion
were well met.</p>

<p>“O vanity,” he exclaimed, “O nothingness! O mortals, ignorant
of their destiny! Ten months ago would she have believed
it? And you, my hearers, would you have thought, while
she was shedding so many tears in this place, while I was discharging
a like office for the Queen, her mother&mdash;that she would
so soon assemble you here to deplore her own loss? ‘Vanity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
vanities; all is vanity.’ Nothing is left for me to say but that
that is the only sentiment which, in presence of so strange a
casualty, grief so well grounded and so poignant permits me to
indulge. No; after what we have just seen, health is but a
name, life is but a dream, glory is but a shadow, charms and
pleasures are but a dangerous diversion.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reflections.</span></h3>

<p>“Keep cool, it will be all one in a hundred years.” So we
say to others, so we try to persuade ourselves; but the tempestuous
teapot seems fatally fixed over the live coals of life and the
teapot tempest must as fatally follow. So mightily important, so
imperative, so irresistibly puissant where those seeming geyser-forces
in their day; perhaps we who laugh at their spent spray
would more wisely learn the lessons they may teach us.</p>

<p>But just as a matter of spent spray and evanishing iridescence,
those struggles of the long ago seem magically beautiful;
and the men and women who figured prominently in them
seem to peer through the mist even as flame-light from which
flame has fled, even as pictured pain, reflex sorrows, unrealities&mdash;spray-shrouded,
color-clouded. Cleopatra, nobly dead, a Queen
forever; ugly old Socrates growing humanly dear and beautiful
to all the ages as he drinks the poison-hemlock; Marie Antoinette,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in the tumbril'">in the tumbrel</ins>, at the guillotine, under the glittering blade;
Charles I. upon the scaffold, on the block awaiting the headsman’s
blow&mdash;these things have been, but now they are not;
yet they endure.</p>

<span class="fs130">BLENHEIM</span></h2>


<p>Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet&mdash;somehow
these names lie contiguous in the mind; so stored away, perhaps,
in the brain cells long ago, and thus forever associative.</p>

<p>Where is all that we know when it is not in play upon the
plane of consciousness? Where is the music of a Rachmaninoff&mdash;while
he sleeps? the reminiscent wealth of a Gladstone&mdash;while
he plays with his great grandchild? the genius of an Edgar
Allan Poe&mdash;while narcotic night silences the streets of Baltimore?</p>

<p>“Potentially down in subconsciousness,” says my glib
psychologist. Eloquent answer! But where and what <em>is</em> subconsciousness?</p>

<p>Better is it silently to gaze wide-eyed, sincere, perplexed into
the omnipresent <em>I-do-not-know</em>, than to squirrel gyrate in the
old vicious circle, or to cob-web life-deep chaos with verbiage,
subterfuge, and explanations that do not explain.</p>

<p>Blenheim, cumulatively at least, stands for the first and
fatal blow that fortune dealt to her fair haired favorite Louis
le Grand. The treaties of Utrecht (1713) and Rastadt (1714)
were an appalling humiliation to the Grand Monarch who had
imperiously dictated the conditions of Aix-la-Chapelle and
Nimeguen.</p>

<p>“There are no longer any Pyrenees”, said Louis XIV., arbiter
of Europe, as his grandson, a boy of seventeen, was raised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the throne as Philip V. of Spain. And then all Europe flew to
arms and for thirteen years blood flowed and war dogs killed
one another because that boy was on the throne and Louis’
witty words had <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'razed the Pyrennees'">razed the Pyrenees</ins>.</p>

<p>This war is known as the War of the Spanish Succession.
A second Grand Alliance was formed; England, Holland,
Sweden, Savoy, Austria fought against France. The famous
English general, Marlborough, and Prince Eugene of Savoy, in
the service of the Emperor, won the memorable battles, Blenheim,
Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.</p>

<p>The allies chose for the Spanish throne, the Archduke
Charles, of Austria, the second son of the Emperor Leopold I.;
but when after ten years’ fighting there was a vacancy in the
imperial line and Archduke Charles suddenly became Emperor
of Austria, the allies, fearing the preponderance of Austria in
European affairs, withdrew their claim. Philip V. grandson of
Louis XIV., was permitted to remain upon the throne of Spain.</p>

<p>The war ended disadvantageously for France. Philip
V. was obliged to renounce his claims to the succession in
France, so that France and Spain might never be under the
same monarch; and thus by miracle-words the august Pyrenees
were reinstated (of course they had been deeply disturbed and
were, in consequence, duly grateful!); England obtained Gibraltar
and the island Minorca; the Duke of Savoy was rewarded
with the island Sicily, and Austria obtained Milan, Naples,
Sardinia, and part of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Thirteen years of bloodshed for the whim of an ambitious
old man! And thousands fell on both sides, who if questioned,
could not honestly have told why they were killing one another.</p>

<p>And the world is as fatuous as Southey’s old “Caspar”, and

“Peterkins”. Why must things like that be; and why do men
speak of successful human slaughter as a “famous victory”;

<h3><span class="smcap">Louis XIV.</span></h3>

<p>Louis le Grand, greatest of the Bourbons, lived too long. For
seventy-two years (1643-1775) Louis was king and for, at least,
fifty years his power was absolute.</p>

<p>Louis’ long reign had as contemporary English history the
disastrous Civil War and the beheading of Charles I. (1649);
the Cromwellian Protectorate (1653); the Restoration of the
Stuarts (1660); the reign of the Merry Monarch, the misfortunes
of James II., the revolution of 1688, the battle of the Boyne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the final deposition and expulsion of James II.; the accession to
the throne of England as King William III., of Louis’ most inveterate
foe, William, Prince of Orange (1688); the death of
King William III. (1702); the reign of Queen Anne, her death,
and the beginning of the House of Hanover (1715).</p>

<p>On the continent <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Thiry'">the Thirty</ins> Years’ War was happily ended by
the treaty of Westphalia (1648). Peter the Great ascended the
throne of Russia (1682). In the great battle of Pultowa (1709)
the power of Sweden was practically annihilated; the madly victorious
career of Charles XII. of Sweden was stopped, and his
successes together with the more solid attainments of his
predecessor, Gustavus Adolphus, were rendered negative; Russia
advanced over her prostrate foe to her place among the
nations.</p>

<p>For forty years success, pleasure, honor, power, and glory
beamed in full radiance upon Louis&mdash;both as man and monarch.
Had he died even as late as 1702 when William, his great rival
foe, died, Louis would have been, to all appearances, the most
blessed of mortals and his reign the most glorious in the annals
of France.</p>

<p>If Pompey the Great had died on his triumphal return from
the Mithradatic war, his life would have been esteemed singularly
happy and free from the reverses and misfortunes that are the
ordinary lot of mortals. But Pompey lived to see all his blushing
honors grow gray, as the admiring eyes that had once
adoringly gazed upon Pompey the Great turned from him, the
setting sun, to the dazzling effulgence of the rising orb, Caius
Julius Cæsar. Pharsalia lay in that alienating gaze and assassination
and bloody death.</p>

<p>The last years of Louis XIV. were burdened with many miseries.
His fortitude and magnanimity under these crushing
blows form, perhaps, his best claim to the title <em>Great</em>. The War
of the Spanish Succession ended with the humiliating treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Utrecht. Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde, Malplaquet had, in
great measure, swept away all that the successful years had, with
blood and treasure, attained. But it was in his domestic
relations that the aged monarch was most sorely afflicted. The
Dauphin died, and a few months later his second son, the Duke
of Burgundy, Fenelon’s favorite pupil, died; Adelaide of Savoy,
wife of the Duke of Burgundy, soon followed her husband to the
grave; their two sons yet lived, and of these, the elder, a promising
youth, died suddenly and there remained only a delicate
infant&mdash;the future Louis XV.</p>

<p>Louis bore all these sorrows with fortitude and sublime
resignation. In the same stoic or heroic attitude of mind he
looked forward into the gathering darkness of death. There is
something truly great in the man who can suffer cataclysmic
misfortunes and deny to himself the relief of a cry of complaint.</p>

<p>Louis died calmly at Versailles, Sept. 1, 1715. His last words
were to his little grandson, a frail boy of five years; sadly the
dying monarch said, “My child, you are about to become a
great king. Do not imitate me either in my taste for building
or in my love of war. Endeavor on the contrary to live in peace
with the neighboring nations. Render to God all that you owe
to him and cause his name to be honored by your subjects.
Strive also to relieve the burdens of your people which I myself
have been unable to do.”</p>

<p>And with this futile advice carrying with it his own confession
of failure Louis le Grand died. The king is dead&mdash;long
live the king!</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV.</span></a><br /><br />

<span class="fs130">PULTOWA</span></h2>


<p>Russia came into existence as a nation on the day of the
victory of the Muscovite troops under Peter the First over the
Swedes and allies under Charles XII. of Sweden, at Pultowa, A.D.
1709. What Russia has attained to since that date is known
and startling significant; what she was previous to that date is
insignificant.</p>

<p>As Creasy says: “Yet a century and a half (two centuries)
have hardly elapsed since Russia was first recognized as a member
of the drama of modern European history&mdash;, previous to the
battle of Pultowa, Russia played no part. Charles V. and his
great rival (Francis I.), our Elizabeth and her adversary Philip
of Spain, the Guises, Sully, Richelieu, Cromwell, De Witt, William
of Orange, and the other leading spirits of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, thought no more about the Muscovite
Czar than we now think about the King of Timbuctoo.”</p>

<p>Sweden lost on that dread day when “fortune fled the royal
Swede”, all that she had toilsomely gained thro’ the slow centuries.
At one blow her fairest provinces were torn from her;
and the rival Russian throne ascended to European prominence
over the prostrate power of Sweden.</p>

<p>Peter the Great even upon the field of victory fully realized
that Pultowa was for him the key to the Baltic. Even amid the
carnage of the slaughter-field where ten thousand men lay dying
or dead and the Vorksla river ran red, his eagle gaze beheld the
Russia resultant from the Treaty of Nystadt. Exultantly he
cried out that “the sun of the morning had fallen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Heaven, and the foundation of St. Petersburg at length stood
firm.”</p>

<p>From dread Pultowa’s day even to the hour, Russia has steadily
advanced by slow, gigantic strides unto a dominating prominence
among the family of nations. The cabinets of Turkey,
Austria, Germany, Italy, France, and England are secretly tho’
effectively influenced by Russia.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Republic or Empire.</span></h3>

<p>Napoleon said that all Europe would ultimately become
either Muscovite or Republican. Which shall it be? The answer
as deduced from present tendencies might be&mdash;Republican:
but no thoughtful observer can fail to regard attentively and
apprehensively that sullen Sclavonic dominance extending insidiously
and simultaneously into India, Persia, Mongolia, Turkey,
the Balkans, and Central Europe.</p>

<p>Amalgamation, the mergence of the many into one, sameness&mdash;quiescent
and content under a powerful, capable, and just administration,
seem to be and ever to have been the ideal form of
government. The empires of the past&mdash;Egyptian, Babylonian,
Persian, Grecian, Roman; the Holy Roman Empire and the
Socialistic commune of the future&mdash;all include as fundamental
principle this solidarity. So far, indeed, it has proved a marsh-light
leading to the marsh; but we dream that it will yet lead
out of and beyond the muddy, bloody marsh and ultimately light
up millennial realms of world-wide oneness, goodness, gladness,
peace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charles XII. of Sweden.</span></h3>

<p>When Charles set out on that expedition having for its object
the castigation and possible subjugation of the upstart
Tartar hordes weakly held together by Peter of Russia,&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Europe believed that Charles would briefly and successfully
accomplish that object.</p>

<p>Sweden was then a power for whose alliance and friendly
interest the most powerful monarchs of Europe contended. Louis
XIV. of France sought the aid of Charles in the war then
waging between France and England; and Marlborough, leader
of the English forces in France, went personally to the court of
Charles in order to solicit that monarch’s aid or at least his
neutrality in the great struggle then in progress.</p>

<p>Charles himself was fully confident of victory; and in his
romantic plans drawn up for the future, the overthrow of Peter
formed only an episode. A year, perhaps, would be required
for the full accomplishment of the Russian enterprise; then he,
Charles of Sweden, victor of Moscow and arbiter from the
Kremlin, would hastily return to western Europe and begin
preparations on a gigantic scale for his master-achievement&mdash;the
dethronement of the Pope of Rome, and the demolition of
the Papacy.</p>

<p>Desire-dream of many; achievement of none: for this magic
Gibraltar elusively endures bearing its age-old scars as brightest
ornamentations. Charles XII. did not, indeed, attack Rome; but
did Pultowa save the Papacy? No: the missiles of the Madman
of the North whether hurled in the real or only in that futile
future plan, would have been equally ineffectual; the magic
rock would, perhaps bear another scar bright shining today as
trophy of its past struggle and victory.</p>

<p>The lesson of history would seem to teach mortals to expect
the unexpected. At Saratoga, at Valmy, at Pultowa, in the
Teutoberger Wald, at Marathon, and at Babylon&mdash;the undreamed
of, the altogether unanticipated, unprepared for, both by the
combatants themselves and the world-spectators&mdash;took place.</p>

<p>Charles XII., who had set out from Sweden with an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of eighty-five thousand men, Swedes and allies, escaped from the
shambles of Pultowa only by swimming across a river red with
blood and thus reaching an alien shore weak, wounded, a fugitive,
and comparatively alone. Eighty-five thousand men died for the
gratification of the personal ambition of the Swedish king; and,
by the irony of fate, for the ruination of their native land and
the aggrandizement of Peter the First, subsequently and, perhaps,
consequently Peter the Great, of Russia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sclavonic versus Teutonic.</span></h3>

<p>The battle of Pultowa was the first decisive victory of the
Sclavonic race over the Germanic. Arnold, in his <cite>Lectures on
Modern History</cite>, says that the last chapter of the history of
Europe will narrate the achievements leading to Muscovite
ascendency and the glories of world-dominant Panslavism.</p>

<p>Do nations and races attain only to a certain degree of excellence
and then deteriorate? And is that the plan fatefully
fixed for the planet Earth? Mycenæ, Troy, Philæ, Babylon,
Athens make answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>A poem, <cite>Christ in the Universe</cite>, by Alice Meynell comes to
mind. In a few master touches the writer describes God’s way
of revealing Himself to us mortals:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“With the ambiguous earth</p>

<p>But do the other planets of our solar system, do the stars,
those countless suns controlling countless planets&mdash;know aught
of God’s way of dealing with our Earth? Or can we even in
loftiest flight of thought conceive “in what guise He walked the

<p>Then the good glad confidence of the soul in touch with God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

<p>They are indeed blessed in whom dwells this abiding confidence,
and for whom at times at least, there is overflow in Te

rolling red; the answerless Whys wailing from out the past forlorn
as Pharaoh-ghosts in search of non-existent mummies; the
chaos of it all, from Memphis to modern Cairo; the damnable

and hope and good glad confidence play dominant and the soul
is exultant in God.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Death of Charles.</span></h3>

<p>Charles XII. never rallied from the defeat of Pultowa. He
did, indeed, linger for a time in Turkey, striving to enlist the
sympathies of the Sultan in his behalf. And history relates
that at last the Sultan yielded to the importunities of Charles,
and that an army was fitted out for the invasion of Russia: but
the command of the forces was entrusted to the Vizier, not to
Charles. And the story runs that the Russians were completely
trapped by the Turkish troops and Pultowa seemed about to be
avenged and the hand of destiny turned backward; when
Catherine, later the wife of Peter the Great and first Empress of
Russia, seeing the hopelessness of exit from the trap into which
the Russians had fallen, went secretly by night into the tent
of the Grand Vizier, and by her charms, and by her gifts of
gold, diamonds, and pearls bribed the stern old soldier so that
he failed to see the following day that the Russians were secretly
stealing away from the trap in which he had caught them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles withdrew to Sweden and, a war having broken out
between Norway and Sweden, he was killed at the siege of
Frederickshall: but just how he met death is not authoritatively
known. He was found dead in the trenches the night preceding
the battle.</p>

<p>Voltaire has sympathetically told the story of Charles XII.
of Sweden. His meteoric career has often been used, as Johnson
happily said, “to point a moral or adorn a tale.” He
ranks with Alexander and Napoleon in personal magnetism, in
phenomenal attainment, and in the ultimate loss and evanishment
of all attained. His name and fame are ever subtly suggestive
of&mdash;</p>

<span class="fs130">SARATOGA</span></h2>


<p>The surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga, though not,
perhaps, properly classed among battles, is, nevertheless, properly
classed among events momentous in their influence upon the
destinies of nations. Looking upon the American Revolution as
a whole and from a dispassionate distance, Burgoyne’s surrender
at Saratoga is seen to be the fateful turning of the tide which
rolled from crest-wave English victory back to slow but sure
English discomfiture and ultimate defeat.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'As result of'">As a result of</ins> the Colonial victory at Saratoga came recognition
of <em>the Independent United States of America</em>, first from
France, later from Spain, and still later from Holland. Confidence
was established; untried troops had stood breast to breast
against veterans of the British army, against skilled Grenadiers,
and these untried troops had won; they had caused the proud
British general to retreat from place to place, they had surrounded
him at last on Saratoga Heights and forced him to
capitulate. The independence of the thirteen original states
and all evolutionary Republican America lay potential in the
victory of Generals Gates and Arnold over Burgoyne and his
veterans at Saratoga.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plan.</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The best laid plans of mice and men</p>
<p class="verse">Gang aft agley.”&mdash;<cite>Burns.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>Burgoyne’s plan was good; and had not General St. Leger
failed to capture Fort Stanwix and then to proceed along the
Mohawk to its confluence with the Hudson and there join his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
force to that of Burgoyne; and had not General Baum failed to
win the battle of Bennington and so secure the magazines of
provisions so sorely needed by the British army; and had not
Lord Howe considered it more advantageous to cross over to the
Delaware and attack Philadelphia, rather than remain at New
York ready for emergency; and had not General Clinton been
retarded in his victorious advance up from Albany; if all, or
perhaps any one of these conditions had been the reverse of
what they were, why, history might be the reverse of what it is.</p>

<p>Momentous little things&mdash;so seeming trifling, inconsequential,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'neglegible--and yet'">negligible&mdash;and yet</ins> potential of cataclysmic calamity! An
insect bores into the heart of an oak, and the forest monarch
falls: a tiny trickling rill freezes in the rock and the mountain
is rent asunder; a pine twig breaks under its weight of snow
and the awful avalanche comes crashing down. In the moral
world, too, the results seem altogether out of proportion to the
cause: a glance of suspicion and the bloom of perfect trust is
gone from the heart forever; an unkind word and love withers,
a deed&mdash;it dies; one lie, one little wormy lie, and the fair integrity
of character has in it the boring insect with which it
may, indeed, flourish full foliage for a season, but by which, in
the end, it must, being hollow hearted, succumb to the storm
and fall and die.</p>

<p>Perhaps when Burgoyne sent for the Indians and made them
part of his fighting force, he then admitted into his moral makeup,
as well as his military, the mighty <em>little thing</em> which should
silently yet forcefully work disaster. For many men who were
irresolute as to which side to join, being indeed loyal at heart
to the mother country and hesitating to strike against her, boldly
threw in their fortunes with the Colonists when they heard that
the Red Man formed part of the force of the advancing army.
They knew what savage warfare meant even better than Burgoyne
knew. Many are inclined to excuse Burgoyne on the plea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that he knew nothing of the horrible atrocities of the Indians
when intoxicated with the blood of battle: but fate did not excuse
him. His Indians never knew the intoxication of victorious
battle&mdash;thanks to the stern resolution of men who fought in defence
of mothers, sisters, wives, and children shuddering in nearby
homes: and as defeat came and ignominious retreat from post
to post before the enraged advance of a conquering foe, the Indians
deserted the army and slunk away through the western
wilds back to their native tribes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Benedict Arnold.</span></h3>

<p>Strange that history remembers only Arnold the Traitor and
not Arnold the hero of Ticonderoga, Quebec, and Saratoga. Too
bad he didn’t die in that brilliant charge upon Burgoyne’s intrenchments,
where after overcoming all obstacles and apparently
just on the point of victory he was wounded in the same leg
that had been painfully injured in the assault on Quebec&mdash;and
carried fainting and profusely bleeding from the field. To be
twice wounded for a cause and then to betray it&mdash;perverse human
heart, who shall know its depths of perversity!</p>

<p>And yet the events since that time, which Arnold could not
foresee or foreknow, rather than the concomitant circumstances
of that time, which Arnold saw and knew, have proclaimed him
Traitor. And had the results been otherwise, had not his own
mad efforts helped turn the tide at Saratoga, Arnold might now
be known as a shrewdly diplomatic young officer who, influenced
by a beautiful Tory wife and seeing the cause of the Colonists
desperate, had timely transferred his allegiance to the
British army and bravely helped along the conquering cause of
the mother country.</p>

<p>And Major Andre sleeps in honored rest in old Westminster
Abbey; while the man twice wounded in battle, the hero of Ticonderoga,
Quebec, and Saratoga sleeps in an unhonored grave having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as epitaph indelibly traced upon surrounding air and earth
and water and sky&mdash;Arnold the Traitor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Frazer.</span></h3>

<p>General Frazer was mortally wounded in the engagement
which took place October 7th. He died in camp the following
day. The Italian historian Botta gives the following account of
his burial. “Toward midnight, the body of General Frazer was
buried in the British camp. His brother officers assembled sadly
around while the funeral service was read over the remains of
their brave comrade, and his body was committed to the hostile
earth. The ceremony, always mournful and solemn of itself,
was rendered even terrible by the sense of recent losses, of present
and future dangers, and of regret for the deceased. Meanwhile,
the blaze and roar of the American artillery amid the
natural darkness and stillness of the night came on the senses
with startling awe. The grave had been dug within range of the
enemy’s batteries; and while the service was proceeding, a cannon
ball struck the ground close to the coffin, and spattered earth
over the face of the officiating chaplain.”</p>

<p>There is something painfully pathetic in the scene thus presented
to the imagination. War has no respect for the rights of
the living or the dying or the dead.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Surrender.</span></h3>

<p>On the 13th of October, 1777, General Burgoyne, besieged by
overpowering numbers on the heights of Saratoga and seeing
that his army was facing disease and famine, and being unable
to establish communication either with Lord Howe or with General
Clinton&mdash;opened negotiations with General Gates as to conditions
of surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>At first General Gates demanded that the royal army should
surrender themselves prisoners of war. Burgoyne refused.</p>

<p>It was later agreed upon that “the troops under General
Burgoyne were to march out of their camp with the honors of
war, and the artillery&mdash;of the entrenchments, to the verge of the
river, where the arms and the artillery were to be left. The
arms to be piled by word of command from their own officers.
A free passage was to be granted to the army under Lieutenant
General Burgoyne to Great Britain upon condition of not serving
again in North America during the present contest.”</p>

<p>These conditions having been formally accepted, an army of
weak and wounded men laboriously descended the heights and
marched out to the place appointed for the laying down of arms.
General Gates was on this occasion extremely courteous, and
the Colonial troops were soon fraternizing with the English
soldiers and striving in every way to supply their many needs
and wants.</p>

<p>General Clinton, who was but fifty miles down the river with
supplies and men, heard with dismay of Burgoyne’s surrender.
Lord Howe’s plans were all broken up by this sudden change
of fortune. And the far away, sleepily stubborn British Parliament
felt the first cold intimation that it might possibly be
<em>wrong</em> and Burke might possibly be <em>right</em> in their respective
estimates of the rebel children in the wide awake, wonderful
New World.</p>

<p>And so the failure of the New York plans, culminating in
Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga, proved to be one of the
mighty <em>little things</em> potential of results that change the destinies
of nations.</p>

<span class="fs130">VALMY</span></h2>


<p>“Bury my heart in Valmy,” said Kellerman, soldier of the
Seven Years’ War, victor of Valmy, Marshal of France under
the first Napoleon, and court favorite of the Bourbons&mdash;as the
shadows of old-age death deepened into darkness. And they
buried his heart in Valmy.</p>

<p>A simple monument on the crest of the hill, the bloodiest spot
of the one-time battle ground, tells to the thoughtful stranger
the story of a restless heart o’er whom as o’er Madame de Stael
and many another heir of a checkered heritage might be engraved
as epitaph, “Here rests one who never rested.”</p>

<p>The era ushered in by the battle of Valmy was especially
prolific of men whose political principles changed violently from
one extreme to the other; only to rebound again and again,
until, at length, weariness and cynic scorn of good in anything
caused them to drift in perplexed acquiescence wherever the
tide rolled longest and strongest. Talleyrand, Dumouriez, Marquis
de la Rouarie, Kellerman, La Fayette, Mirabeau, Duc de
Chartres, and even Napoleon Bonaparte were, in great measure,
moulded into their respective historic moulds by the lurid
lightning play of antithetic forces ever fatefully flashing and
slashing and crashing around them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">September Twentieth.</span></h3>

<p>Yet in August, 1792, when sixty thousand Prussians, and
forty thousand Austrians and fifteen thousand of the old French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> started out upon that “military promenade to Paris”:
or on the morning of September 20th, when that victoriously
advancing column prepared gaily for its first skirmish with the
raw revolutionary levies who filled the passes of the Argonne
wooded heights and threatened to impede that “promenade”&mdash;who
could see, or who could dare to dream what the issue of
that encounter would be; what results would follow; what rivers
of blood would flow; what lordly heads would roll from under
the guillotine; what national madness would break out barking
at the peace of Europe; what mighty Madman would arise
urging on that national madness even to Wagram, Austerlitz,
Moscow, Leipsic, Waterloo!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Retribution.</span></h3>

<p>Had Kellerman failed to come up just in time to join forces
with Dumouriez: had the Prussian advance been just an hour or
two earlier: had the heavy mists lifted from the Valmy hill and
Argonne wood revealing the relative positions of Kellerman and
Dumouriez: had the forcing of the defile by Clairfayt and his
Austrian corps proved fatally successful: had the Duke of
Brunswick resolutely charged a second time up that hill of
bristling bayonets: had the King of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Prusia, urged'">Prussia, urged</ins> on by a
vision of the future, authoritatively commanded that the hill
be taken and himself led the charge: ah! so we learnedly say
from the calm eminence far away, but history is made in the
low blind fury of the fray. Perhaps, too, there were potently at
work upon that fated battlefield, forces that elude the gaze of
the dreamer on the height far away:&mdash;a determining animus,
moral and spiritual potencies formed by the slow centuries and
long controlled, but now liberated and wildly free. Ghosts of
ten thousand wrongs may have arisen between the gilded ranks
of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> and the ragged rows of the Carmagnoles:
and, as the spirits that arose over the tent of Richard the Third,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the night before the battle of Bosworth Field, cursed Richard
and blessed Richmond; threatened Richard with defeat and
death on the morrow and cheered Richmond with hopes and
promises of victory; fought intangibly, invisibly, yet potently
present amid the awful carnage of Bosworth field even until
death trampled down Richard: so, in like manner, may the
ghosts of ten thousand wrongs have arisen between the men of
the old <em>regime</em> and of the rebellious new&mdash;fighting for their fellow-wrongs
still writhing in the flesh, fighting the old, old fight
of retaliation, compensation, stern adjudication, infinite justice.
As the sun’s rays that reach earth are but one-millionth of the
rays emitted by the sun, so for every thing known, bright shining
on the historic page, there are a million things unknown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Battle.</span></h3>

<p>About seven o’clock on that battle morn as the mists were
dissipating, the successfully united French forces saw with dismay
the slowly advancing army of the allies; long lines of
Prussian cavalry, Austrian light troops, solid columns of infantry,
batteries of artillery filled the valley and moved slowly,
sinuously toward the Valmy height.</p>

<p>Dumouriez anxiously scanned the white strained faces of his
untried troops. Would they fail him in the crucial hour? Would
they break away in panic rout when the death-play began? It
was their custom.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“He who fights and runs away</p>
<p class="verse">May live to fight another day.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>At Tournay, at Lille, and in general throughout the opening
campaign this uncertain “heap of shriekers” had fled away as
satyrs pursued by Pan when the death-play began. Would the
Carmagnoles of today, and, at deepest heart, the <em>Jacquerie</em> of
many a yesterday, dare to fight face to face and hand to hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
against the august <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">seigneurs</i> of the old regime&mdash;late their dread
lords and masters? Three hundred years of culture lay between
them.</p>

<p>Of all who took part in the battle that day, either among
the allies or the revolutionary forces, perhaps not one realized
the full importance of what had taken place as did Johan Wolfgang
von Goethe&mdash;then a young man and comparatively unknown;
he had followed the allies as a spectator, a curious
seeker of strange scenes, a bold hot-blood eager as his own Wilhelm
Meister to taste adventure at its source and to know the
ways of the world in love and in war. Goethe, with the unerring
insight of genius, perceived that victory to the Carmagnoles
marked a new era. In his own words to comrades in camp on
the night following the battle; “From this place and from this
day forth commences a new era in the world’s history, and you
can all say you were present at its birth.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">France a Republic.</span></h3>

<p>Simultaneously with victory at Valmy, France broke from the
cocoon of monarchical forms and proclaimed herself a Republic.
Even while the battle was raging, the National Convention
in Paris were engaged in this deliberation, this liberation.
The Republic of France dates from September 20th, 1792. And
under the regrettable excesses of the Revolution, the reactionary
repression of the First Empire, of the Bourbon restoration,
the revolt of 1830, of 1848, even to Sedan and the hour&mdash;the
spirit of democracy, of liberty and independence born Sept.
20th, 1792, has flourished and flourishes indestructibly, imperishably.</p>

<p>And yet as Dumouriez said, “France (revolutionary) was
within a hair’s breadth of destruction.” And had victory gone
that day to the allies, the throne of Louis XVI. would have been
reinstated on foundations so firm that centuries would not shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
it. For in La Vendee and throughout <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Brittainy there was'">Brittany there was</ins> at
that time a strong uprising in favor of the throne: men such
as the admirable old Marquis de la Rouarie were abandoning
the Revolutionary cause and turning decisively back to monarchical
principles; moreover the recent atrocious September
massacres had alienated the more conservative and thoughtful
men throughout France. Never was the time more propitious
for the return of the mild and humane Louis XVI., the re-establishment
of the monarchy, the substitution of Reform for
Revolution, and of concessive peace for fratricidal war. But
by that hair’s breadth republican France won; and that winning
mustered out the gentlemanly old regime and ushered in the
arrogant awful new.</p>

<p>The spirit of Valmy flies eagle-free over the world today. It
is the spirit making possible the face to face and hand to hand
fight between the laborer and the capitalist, the soldier and the
king, woman and man: and that Spirit tells strange and terrible
tales of victory.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVII" id="Chapter_XVII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII.</span></a><br /><br />

<span class="fs130">WATERLOO</span></h2>


<p>Waterloo stands for the sudden darkening of the blazing
comet, Napoleon; and for the return of France to the realm of
the real after twenty-five years of hysterical unreality. Consequentially,
too, Waterloo meant the relaxation of the terrible
war-tension which had held rigid both Europe and the civilized
world. The victor-trampling of Napoleon’s troops was heard on
this side of the Atlantic; and our second war with England
(1812-1814) was, in great measure, both in origin and in purposeless
conclusion, the result of that victor-trampling.</p>

<p>After Waterloo (June 18, 1815) the war-weary world snapped
tension and sank to rest; tho’ perhaps the secret terror tremor
was not utterly stilled until six years later (May 5, 1821) when
Napoleon, Man of Destiny, lay dead at St. Helena.</p>

<p>Youth may idolize Napoleon, age may condemn: but so long
as human nature is what it is, we ordinary mortals&mdash;knowing
the difficulties that attend success, eminence, excellence; knowing
the almost insuperable obstacles that bar the way to supremacy,
be it cosmopolitan, national, provincial, municipal, or parochial&mdash;will
ever regard with loving wonder the man who won
excellence and world-wide supremacy.</p>

<p>It has been said that a base man or a thoroughly selfish man
cannot truly love or inspire love. Whom did Napoleon love?
History answers <em>Napoleon</em>. Yet Napoleon certainly inspired love.
Josephine, the army, the Old Guard devotedly loved Napoleon.
In the song from the French “To Napoleon” beginning with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
line, “Must thou go, my glorious Chief”, some ardent admirer
lamenting Napoleon’s downfall and doom cries out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“My chief, my king, my friend, adieu!</p>
<p class="verse4">Never did I droop before;</p>
<p class="verse">Never to my sovereign sue,</p>
<p class="verse4">As his foes I now implore:</p>
<p class="verse">All I ask is to divide</p>
<p class="verse4">Every peril he must brave;</p>
<p class="verse">Sharing by my hero’s side</p>
<p class="verse4">His fall, his exile, and his grave.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And elsewhere we read that at Napoleon’s farewell “all wept,
but particularly Savary, and a Polish officer, who had been
exalted from the ranks by Bonaparte. He clung to his master’s
knees; wrote a letter to Lord Keith, entreating permission to accompany
him, even in the most menial capacity, which could
not be admitted.”</p>

<p>Too bad Nap didn’t die with the Old Guard. At <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Belle
Alliance</i> in the midst of that last square of his death-devoted
friends and lovers Napoleon should have died. “The Guard
dies, it does not surrender” replied that gallant band as they
awaited the last terrible onslaughts of the victor-breathing
troops and thus were they hewn down even to a man. And
while this slaughter of his Guard was going on, Napoleon, urged
and aided by Marshal Soult, was galloping away from the field.
Too bad Napoleon didn’t die at Waterloo.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quatre-Bras and Ligny.</span></h3>

<p>Hoping to strike a decisive blow at the Prussian forces under
Blücher before they could effect a junction with Wellington’s
advancing army, Napoleon marched upon Ligny (June 16,
1815). He left Marshal Ney at <em>Quatre-Bras</em> with instructions to
oppose the advance of the English army towards Ligny, and to
fight if necessary. Ney, taking advantage of Wellington’s temporary
absence, (he had ridden across to confer with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Blücher
and was then hastening back) resolved to attack the Anglo-Netherland
forces under the Prince of Orange. He was repulsed;
nevertheless he succeeded in checking the advance of the
army towards Ligny.</p>

<p>In the meantime Napoleon had gained a victory over eighty
thousand Prussian troops under Blücher, and they were even
then in ignominious retreat towards Wavre. Napoleon ordered
Marshall Grouchy to follow up the Prussians and to prevent
them, at any cost, from joining forces with Wellington. Blücher
had been wounded at Ligny and his army thoroughly demoralized:
Grouchy, with an army of thirty thousand men, seemed
more than a match for such an opponent; and doubtless, Napoleon,
when hastening away from Ligny to oppose his more
formidable foe, felt sure that the Prussians and Blücher were
happily eliminated from the conflict confronting him.</p>

<p>But in that conference between Wellington and Blücher, it
had been agreed upon that in case of defeat at Ligny, Blücher
should retreat towards Wavre, and Wellington would withdraw
towards Waterloo; so that they would still be in line of direct
communication, and a union of forces might be effected. Wellington
and Blücher trusted each other implicitly. “Whether after
victory or defeat, come to me at Waterloo,” said Wellington.
“I will come,” answered Blücher grimly and&mdash;he came.</p>

<p>The following day (June 17) a reinforcement under Bülow
reached Blücher at Wavre; thus the loss sustained at Ligny
was made good. At Grouchy’s approach the following morning
(June 18) Blücher resolved to sacrifice deliberately a regiment
of seventeen thousand men in order to detain Grouchy and
keep him from returning to Napoleon, while he (Blücher) and
Bülow with the bulk of the Prussian army should hasten to the
aid of Wellington at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Not at Wavre but at Waterloo was destiny at work; this
Blücher knew and he acted accordingly: this Grouchy did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
know; and after completely routing with great slaughter the
Prussians under Thielman, he kept up a meaningless pursuit following
a will-o-the-wisp, whilst Napoleon, after sending to him
messenger after messenger urging his aid, stood still at last and
deadly pale under the gorgeous June sunset, and saw all his
hopes and dreams go down in darkness as the ominous moving
cloud emerging from the direction of Wavre and advancing,
glitteringly advancing, proved to be Blücher&mdash;not Grouchy.</p>

<p>That deliberate leaving of seventeen thousand men as a bait
in a trap for the victorious French forces thundering onward
from Ligny is typical of the demon ingenuity of war. I have
read somewhere that in darkest Africa the lure to the tiger trap
is a kid securely fastened. Its fearful bleatings attract the
night prowling brute: there is a spring: then awful shrieks
arise growing shriller and shriller as the pangs of being devoured
alive grow tenser and more terrible: by this time the
cannibals are upon the scene and the trap is sprung.</p>

<p>Seventeen thousand soldiers as kid to the tiger lure&mdash;and
men call themselves civilized! Could a woman do that? No;
woman is higher in the moral scale than man. And the
higher, thank God, is the kinder, tenderer, the more compassionate.
Wars and all hellish machinations of cruelty must cease
as the race, as a whole, advances into that higher. And advancement,
even tho’ zigzag, shall ultimately attain to the higher
and even to the highest. We dream so.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">King Making Victory.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps no other battlefield of the historic past has been
more frequently described or rendered more vivid to mental
vision than the field of Waterloo. Victor Hugo’s masterly portrayal
in <cite>Les Miserables</cite> is doubtless the best; but Sir Walter
Scott, Lord Byron, Captain Siborne, and Napoleonic writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> have added richness of tonal qualities to the
monochrome.</p>

<p>Those two long lines of undulating hills running nearly
parallel, with a valley half a mile in width between; the allied
army under Wellington on the northern ridge, the devoted
French forces on the southern; the artillery of each army firing
incessantly upon the other over the heads of the combatants in
the valley and on the lower slope; the forest of Soignies darkly
waving in the rear of Wellington’s forces; the village and ravine
at the right warding off a possible flank movement; the two
hamlets La Haye and Papillote at the left, strongly garrisoned
of course and then, too, expectant of Blücher’s approach from
Wavre; Hougoumont, an old stone chateau surrounded by a
copse of beech trees, half way down the slope nearly in front of
the British right center&mdash;strongly fortified, most important,
strategic; Hougoumont&mdash;to be taken and retaken seven times
during that day of destiny and held at last in flaming ruins
by the British; the farm house La Haie Sainte somewhat down
from the British left center, heavily garrisoned, expectant of
what came; the French forces in superb battle array on the
Charleroi crest of the hill, with an open way to France behind
them and the hamlet La Belle Alliance, Napoleon’s headquarters,
and their idol Napoleon&mdash;before: why every school-boy
knows the plan of this most famous battlefield!</p>

<p>Had Napoleon’s star not been fatally descendant he must
have won at Waterloo. His forces, seventy-two thousand, were
numerically stronger than the opposing forces seventy-one thousand
eight hundred and five, under Wellington; then, too, his
army was a unit and unanimously devoted to him, whereas
Wellington’s army was a mixup of Belgians, Dutch, Nassauers,
Brunswickers, Hanoverians, with only twenty-four thousand
English troops upon whom he could implicitly rely. Wellington
knew and Napoleon knew that the Belgian and Netherland forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
would far rather be fighting under the French eagles than against
them. And in truth these regiments did disgracefully run away
from before the advancing French columns in the crisis of the
strife, and the demoralizing effect of their flight was counteracted
only by the superhuman efforts and life-sacrificing devotedness
of England’s two brave heroes Picton and Ponsonby.</p>

<p>It is true that Wellington confidently awaited a strong
Prussian reinforcement, eighty thousand&mdash;and Blücher. It is
equally true that owing to heavy rainfall and consequently almost
impassable roads between Wavre and Waterloo, Blücher
who was eagerly looked for at 3 p. m. did not reach the field
until 7 p. m. and at that time the battle was practically won
by the British.</p>

<p>Had Napoleon’s pristine favor been accorded him&mdash;the magic
favor of fate that had made possible Areola, Rivoli, Jena, Ulmn,
Wagram, Austerlitz&mdash;he would have defeated Wellington at
Waterloo, advanced upon the advancing Prussians and completely
routed them; and then he would have hastened to crush
separately and before a junction could be effected the various
contingencies of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Coaliton even'">the Coalition even</ins> then converging upon him
by way of the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. But fate
forsook her favorite at Waterloo. Olympian Zeus, jealous of
Promethean man, has decreed that if once, then certainly not
<em>twice</em>, shall a mortal transcend the lot of mortals.</p>

<p>It rained all night long that memorable seventeenth of June,
the night before the battle. Of those forces that thus drearily
bivouacked upon the opposing hills, some fifty thousand men
thus passed their last night upon earth. Nature wept for them.
The skies dissolved in tears at the mad folly of mortals. Rain,
inconsolable rain, fell from the early afternoon of the seventeenth,
thro’ all the night, and sobbingly drizzled late on the
morning of the eighteenth as the armies went out to battle.</p>

<p>That dreary last night of life for fifty thousand men&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
did it mean to them! Did any flint-glitterings, struck out of
sullen gloom, zigzag thro’ the darkness of their minds? Why
should they fight? Why should they kill and be killed on the
morrow? Wellington, Napoleon&mdash;what were they to the common
soldier; he would be free, he would go to his home, he
would live his life as God gave it to him to live. Desert on the
eve of battle! Ah, no! Yet, why not?</p>

<p>“So free we seem, so fettered fast we are.” Honor bound
tonight and death bound tomorrow night! Who of those sleeping
in yonder tents, under the rain, shall fall tomorrow? Whom
shall he kill? Who may kill&mdash;him?</p>

<p class="verseq">“Some one has blundered.”</p>
<p class="verse6">* <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span> <span class="pad2">*</span></p>
<p class="verseq">“Theirs not to make reply,</p>
<p class="verse">Theirs not to reason why,</p>
<p class="verse">Theirs but to do and die.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Again, why? Half a million men must die because Napoleon
blundered&mdash;Why! And the tears of the rain made answer.</p>

<p>At half past eleven o’clock Sunday morning, June 18, shortly
after the village church bells had ceased ringing, the French
forces began descending the slope of the southern ridge and
were soon dashing across the valley. Their first object was the
capture of Hougoumont. In the words of Creasy: “Napoleon
began the battle by directing a powerful force from his left
wing under his brother, Prince Jerome, to attack Hougoumont.
Column after column of the French now descended from the
west of the southern heights, and assailed that post with fiery
valor, which was encountered with the most determined bravery.
The French won the copse round the house, but a party of
British Guards held the house itself throughout the day. Amid
shell and shot, and the blazing fragments of part of the buildings,
this obstinate contest was continued. But still the English
held Hougoumont, tho’ the French occasionally moved forward
in such numbers as enabled them to surround and mask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
this post with part of their troops from their left wing, while
others pressed onward up the slope, and assailed the British
right.”</p>

<p>The fight then became general all along the line. As the
French advanced to the left center the Dutch and Belgians
under Blyant threw down their arms and fled from the field,
whether as result of fright, disinclination to fight, or treachery
will, perhaps, never be known. The second line consisted of
two brigades of English infantry and with these the gallant
Picton charged the advancing French columns already flushed
with victory. Volley after volley thinned the advancing ranks
and then, at the opportune moment, the British made a fierce
bayonet charge. The French reeled back in confusion, halted,
and staggering tried to rally, but just then a brigade of English
Cavalry rushed down upon them. Two thousand French soldiers
were taken prisoners, the artillery-men of Ney’s seventy-four
advanced guns were sabered and the guns rendered useless.
The British cut the throats of the horses of the artillery wagons,
and severing the traces, left these poor brutes maddened with
pain to add to the horror of the slaughter. In this charge
Picton fell.</p>

<p>At La Haie Sainte, the fortified farm house that served as
protection of the British left wing, the French performed prodigies
of valor. At last Donzelot’s infantry gained possession of
this long desired point of vantage.</p>

<p>About 4 o’clock a corps of Prussians under Bülow made its
appearance at the French right. This disconcerted Napoleon’s
plan of general assault on the allied center. He sent ten thousand
men under Lobau to hold Bülow in check.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Wellington ordered another assault to be
made for the re-capture of La Haie Sainte. Ney repelled this
attack, but sent for reinforcements. Napoleon sent him the
cuirassiers under Milhaud. By mistake the forces of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
cavalry under Lefebvre-Desnouettes <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'joined the curassiers'">joined the cuirassiers</ins> and
hastened to the assistance of La Haie Sainte. Ney finding himself
in command of two powerful bodies of horse resolved to
take the offensive; he accordingly renewed the attack upon the
British center. Wellington had arranged his men in squares;
these hedged in with bayonets presented an almost impenetrable
front to the enemy. Still they showed signs of wavering; and
Ney seeing his advantage sent hurriedly for a reinforcement of
infantry; Napoleon could send no more.</p>

<p>Lobau had succeeded in driving Bülow out of the village
(Planchenoit) on the French right; La Haie Sainte was still
in the possession of the French; and could Ney have obtained
the infantry he desired, historians agree that he would have succeeded
in forcing the British center. That hour was the pivotal
beam of the battle and it seemed about to dip in favor of France.</p>

<p>Nap watched the scene from the opposite hill. How his
heart must have thrilled to the air of old time victory; Wagram,
Austerlitz,&mdash;Waterloo!</p>

<p>It was evening, the western sky was crimson with sunset, night
must soon come and end the conflict. Wellington, too, was
ardently longing that “the night would come or&mdash;Blücher.”</p>

<p>And just then on the ominous French right whence Bülow’s
division had been routed an hour ago, another darkly moving
mass of men appeared. Was it Grouchy&mdash;hope! or Blücher&mdash;despair!
It was Blücher. Napoleon turned deadly pale; he
asked for a glass of water but in his agitation, he spilled more
than half the contents ere his trembling hand could lift the
glass to his lips. Thus bitterly began Napoleon’s Waterloo.</p>

<p>Napoleon concentrated all his available forces, the reserve
troops, and the Old Guard for one more Herculean attack upon
the British. Across the plain they dashed, Ney leading the
charge, and over their heads played the French artillery in an
incessant rain of lead upon the opposing height. Men there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
were falling under it like leaves in autumn. Wellington, observing
the havoc wrought by the French guns, ordered the British
Guards to lie prone upon the earth so as to be out of range of
the bullets. As the French approached the foot of the ridge,
and even as they advanced up the slope, the fire from Napoleon’s
headquarters continued, but when they had fairly gained the
height, the French guns ceased firing.</p>

<p>On rushed the devoted French columns led by Ney, <em>bravest
of the brave</em>, who, covered with blood and dust, hatless, with
clothing torn, and on foot&mdash;five horses having been shot under
him&mdash;still dared to dream of victory. As the French reached
the top of the hill, for one madly exultant moment they thought
that the enemy had fled; but at Wellington’s hissing command,
“Up, Guards, and at them!”, they stood aghast as the very
earth seemed to open and pour out brigade after brigade of
British Red Coats. The onslaught was awful. Over the crest
of the hill and far down the slope the French were driven saber-slaughtered
and slaughtering. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Garde Reculée</i> (The Guard is
repulsed)&mdash;this cry with its ominous suggestion sped from
blanched lip to lip. And soon the most desperate of all defeat
cries <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauve qui peut!</i> (All’s lost: save himself who can!) became
general among the fleeing French forces.</p>

<p>At La Belle Alliance Napoleon attempted to make a rallying
point; he hastily pressed his few devoted followers into a
square, declaring it his intention to perish with them. But as
it is the surgeon that has most mercilessly used his knife upon
others, who shrinks back in awful dread from the knife as used
upon himself: so Napoleon who had seen thousands of soldiers
die of bloody wounds, could not endure for himself that which
he had been willing to witness in others. As the English drew
near and, seeing the hopelessness of the French position, called
upon them to surrender; and even as General Cambronne gallantly
replied, “The Guard dies; it does not surrender”, Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
spurred back his horse, turned, and galloped at full
speed from the field.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Exile.</span></h3>

<p>Napoleon a second time signed a treaty of abdication just
one hundred days after his flagrant violation of the first treaty
of abdication. One hundred days of doubtful triumph and then&mdash;Waterloo:
was it worth while!</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'The Macchievellian'">The Machiavellian</ins> principles&mdash;honorable fraud; splendid
rascality; a ruler should combine the qualities of the fox and
the lion; no matter what the means may be, the vulgar are ever
caught by appearances and judge only by the event&mdash;which Napoleon
had so deeply imbibed from perusal of his favorite book
<cite>Il Principe</cite>, suffered sudden collapse of inflation and wraith-like
glimmered as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'will-o-the' wisps'">will-o-the-wisps</ins> in a bog. That stripping
away of names and epithets and phrases and opinions and customs
and sunlight success from the&mdash;Lie: and that Lie in naked
hideousness black-branded on the soul for self and all the world
to see;&mdash;how terrible a triumph of the unseen over the seen,
the real over the apparent, the truth over the lie! What Austerlitz
concealed Waterloo revealed. Outlaw of Europe, execrable
wretch, vile miscreant whom no promises or vows could hold in
honor, etc., were among the uncouth Teutonic free translations of
Nap’s subtly soft <cite>Il Principe</cite>.</p>

<p>And Josephine was dead; she had died a year ago while
Nap was at Elba. Josephine never knew the worst about Napoleon;
she never could have known the “execrable wretch” as
the Congress of Vienna knew him. Love and hate see differently
the same objects. As she would gladly have followed Nap to
Elba, so, too, would she have been a pitying angel at his side
in the world-execration after Waterloo, and in the bitter loneliness
of St. Helena. Was Nap, the real, what he was as known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and loved by Josephine or what he was as seen and hated by
the Congress of Vienna; or neither?</p>

<p>That portrait of Napoleon by Delaroche comes to mind. We
are sorry for Nap in his hour of ignominy; we forgive him all
the sorrows that he caused&mdash;to others; we look with him fascinated
into the fatal future, we grieve with the stoic grief of
the Man of Destiny.</p>

<p>Meissonier’s companion pictures “1807: Friedland” and
“1814: Retreat from Moscow” come to mind. Full success-sun
convergent from Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram shines in “1807”;
penumbral shadows gray-flecked with snows from Borodino,
Moscow, Berizina lower in “1814”.</p>

<p>Louis David’s statuesque picture “Napoleon Crossing the
Alps” comes to mind. It seems the “French Revolution on
horse-back” yet controlled, goaded up the ascent, led out from
bleeding France, and destiny-plunging on towards Italy,
Prussia, Austria, Russia.</p>

<p>David’s canvas “Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine”
comes sadly to mind. From that rhapsody of color-splendor to
bleak Helena surf-lashed by the sea; from that act of crowning
exaltation to the signing of abdication at Fontainebleau; from
that supreme success in life to a failure-grave under the willows:
ah! surely there throbs within and between these antithetic
scenes all that enigmatic life may hold for us mortals. Nothing
exists beyond&mdash;in pleasure or in pain, in honor or dishonor,
in success or failure, in highest or lowest.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cor ne edito</span> (Eat not the Heart).</span></h3>

<p>Napoleon spent the last six years of life on the island St.
Helena (Oct. 16, 1815&mdash;May 5, 1821). There are various stories
told as to his bitter loneliness whilst in exile, his ceaseless repining
at fate, his chafing chagrin under the cautious coldness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of Sir Hudson Lowe. Nap is most frequently represented walking
alone on the shore, his hands locked behind, his head lowered
and his “broad brow oppressive with his mind” bent sullenly
forward. Again as a caged eagle he stands for hours at
a time on the rocky ledge looking out over the gray waste of
waters with eyes straining towards France. And old ocean always
inimical to Napoleon and coldly conscious of Aboukir and
Trafalgar enjoys indifferently its final triumph. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'True to Brittania'">True to Britannia</ins>,
Ruler of the Wave, the gray waters roll impenetrable to
bribery or betrayal, impervious to sentiment or sympathy. Napoleon,
victor of a hundred fields, king-maker, arbiter of Europe,
is caught and caged; his eagle wings all torn and bleeding yet
dash against the bars; he is eating his heart, O restless sea, and
he gazes on thee: old ocean rolled responseless.</p>

<p>Am I tonight participant in the woe that had its hours of
agony one hundred years ago? It seems so.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hero Worship.</span></h3>

<p>Balance is hard. And to see clearly all sides of a subject,
however conducive to balance, is destructive of enthusiasm.
Hero worship is, perhaps, a phase of hysteria, but without it
there are no heroes. No name upon the historic page, from
Homer’s Achilles down to Carlyle’s Cromwell, but shines with
luster luminous from hero worship. Alexander, Hannibal,
Cæsar, Charlemagne, Napoleon&mdash;the world will ever love them,
not perhaps for what they were, but for the vision splendid
with which they are attended, and which was formed and fitted
to them by admiring love.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Retrospect.</span></h3>

<p>As Nap paced sleeplessly his rock kingdom under the flaky
stars, did memory ever conjure up a strange night scene in old
Vincennes? The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'young Duc d' Enghein'">young Duc d’Enghien</ins>, last of the race of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
great Conde, was asleep in bed. Suddenly, by order of the First
Consul, the French soldiery aroused the sleeper, dragged him
from his luxurious couch, hurried him across the French frontier,
tried him by a military commission, and then, in a ditch of the
castle grounds, that very night, by order of the First Consul,
they shot to death the gay young man. And they tied a lantern
to his breast that it might serve as target to his heart. Did
Nap see that night scene from under the flaky stars of St.
Helena? His <cite>Memoires</cite> do not so record.</p>

<p>Did the treacherously yielding waves that lapped his island
home ever suggest to Nap that horror scene, when after Austerlitz,
as the fleeing enemy were escaping over the frozen lake,
the French artillery, by order of the Emperor, played heavily
upon the ice; it cracked, broke, crashed down, and thousands
sank within the treacherous waves. Or did they softly sigh of
Berezina, when the heavily laden bridge broke down and his
own devoted soldiers and friends&mdash;those who had stood by him
at Borodino, in Moscow, and in the dread Retreat&mdash;struggled
in the icy waters? Nap’s <cite>Memoires</cite> do not so record.</p>

<p>And the dark rolling billows surf-capped&mdash;did they at times
suggest low mounds in churchyards, or ominous ridges on recent
battle grounds? Half a million men had died that Nap might
rise and&mdash;fall. All Europe, from Lisbon to Moscow was dotted
with their graves. Surely in the retrospective leisure of exile,
however it may have been in the fever of the empire-strife,
there was regret for all the young life suddenly darkened into
death; there was awakening self-knowledge regretful, remorseful;
there was lamentation at the futility of it all, the horror,
the agony, the shame; there was prayer, the bitter prayer of
Thais of the Desert, “Thou who hast made me have mercy
on me!” Maybe: not ours to know the enigmatic heart of man;
we only say there is no record of such feelings in Nap’s memoirs.</p>

<p>Did the year 1809 loom sullen in retrospect? That year held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in record the capture of Pope Pius VII. and his confinement at
Savona; the ban of excommunication pronounced against Napoleon
by his illustrious prisoner; and Nap’s divorce from
Josephine.</p>

<p>The Emperor was at this time at the height of his career.
He was drunk with power. In his hand as playthings were
the kingdoms of Europe, and he awarded them as whim or
pleasure urged. To his brother Joseph, too scrupulous to be
great, Nap condescendingly gave the throne of Spain; to his
brother Louis, Holland; to his brother Jerome, Westphalia; to a
favorite general, Bernadotte, Sweden; to Murat, Naples. At his
touch, the Holy Roman Empire&mdash;no longer, indeed, either holy
or Roman or an empire&mdash;had crumbled into dust. Germany
lay prostrate; Austria humbled; Russia chastened, yet friendly.
Only England, secure in her watery kingdom, dared to oppose
his plans and resist his power.</p>

<p>And then this madman on the dizzy height dreamed a glorious
dream. The Pontiff, Pius VII., prisoner at Savona, would
annul the marriage with Josephine; then he would marry the
sister of the Tsar of Russia; then with the help of Russia he
would conquer India and “so strike England to the heart.”
After that “it will be possible to settle everything and have done
with this business of Rome and the Pope. The cathedral of
Paris will become that of the Catholic world.” And Napoleon
shall be all in all. Perhaps, too, this rhapsody ended half
audibly with the adulatory words of the prefect of Arras, “God
created Napoleon and then rested from His works.”</p>

<p>But as seen from gray Helena, the Pope did not annul the
marriage with Josephine, nor did Nap marry the sister of
Tsar Alexander or long retain the friendship of Russia; nor did
he conquer India and so strike England to the heart; nor did
he ever have done with that business of Rome and the Pope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
That “business” has seen the rise and fall of many&mdash;and yet
shall see.</p>

<p>Was Napoleon a Catholic? He died in the bosom of the
Catholic church after having devoutly received the sacraments.
To General Montholon he said: “I was born in the Catholic
religion; I wish to fulfil the duties it imposes and to receive
the succors it administers.” On another occasion he said, “It
would rest my soul to hear Mass.” These words having been
reported to the Pontiff, Pope Pius VII., one time prisoner at
Savona, the gentle old man immediately petitioned the English
government to send a priest to minister to the spiritual
wants of Napoleon. In compliance with the papal request the
Abbe Vignali was sent to St. Helena.</p>

<p>Napoleon in his <cite>Memoires</cite>, speaking of Pius VII., calls him
“an old man full of tolerance and light”; and in euphemistic
reference to his troubles with the pontiff he writes, “Fatal
circumstances embroiled our cabinets; I regret it exceedingly.”</p>

<p>But whatever Nap may have been in exile at St. Helena,
certainly in 1809-10, as arbiter of Europe, he was an arch
enemy to the Catholic church, and he acted in flagrant violation
of all that the Church stands for. And had his phenomenal
success continued to favor him, he would, without doubt, have
lived and died an enemy to the Church.</p>

<p>Napoleon never ceased to be a deist. “Who made all that,
Gentlemen?” he said one night as he and his friends were gazing
at the starry heavens. As a statesman he perceived that religion
is an ally to good government, and doubtless he was
sincere when he said, “A society without religion is like a ship
without a compass; there is no good morality without religion.”
Nap’s re-establishment of the Church in France after the Revolution,
and the Concordat made in the beginning of his reign; the
six years spent at St. Helena and his death there, would seem to
testify that Napoleon was at deepest heart a sincere child of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that Church so tolerant of human frailty and so divinely compassionate
towards those who come contritely back from error’s
devious ways and would sleep the last sleep in her bosom.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Let Wars Cease.</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The drying up a single tear has more</p>
<p class="verse">Of honest fame than shedding seas of gore.</p>
<p class="verse">And why? because it brings self-approbation:</p>

<p class="verse">Are nothing but a child of Murder’s rattles.”&mdash;<cite>Byron.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The rattles of this preeminent child of Murder were heard
in deafening clatter over all Europe for twenty years; there is
a singular dearth of the acts that have honest fame or that
conduce to self-approbation. A steely selfishness from first to
last marks the career of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Nearly a hundred years have passed away since Nap’s dread
Waterloo. There have been wars since then and much blood
has flowed, tho’ perhaps of no one battle since Waterloo may it
decisively be said that had victory gone other than it did go,
all subsequent history would be essentially different from what it
is.</p>

<p>Perhaps in our Civil War the three days’ battle of Gettysburg
may seem to hold a determinant place. The continuance
of slavery and the break up of the young Republic of the West
would surely have made a momentous page of history&mdash;but one
with which we are happily unfamiliar. Nor would the import of
that page affect only us and our Republic; both continents are
now more or less favorably influenced by what we now are, so
may they have been unfavorably influenced by what we might
have been. But Gettysburg is too near for perfect vision. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
too, the personal element, favorable or unfavorable, is conducive
to myopia. So with Waterloo, secure in a hundred years’
perspective, the Battles of Destiny end.</p>

<p>In a hasty glance over the historic field from Memphis,
5000 B. C. to Mexico, 1914 A. D.&mdash;the great conflicts of nations
loom sullenly as blood red peaks daubing the darkness.
There is no sequence; they lead nowhere; they just sullenly,
luridly bleed. Memphis; Nineveh; Babylon; Marathon, Salamis,
Syracuse, Ægospotami, Leuctra, Mantinea, Chæronea; Granicus,
Issus, Arbela; Ipsus; Cannæ, Zama, Cynoscephalæ, Magnesia,
Pharsalia, Philippi, Actium; Teutobergerwald; Chalons; Tours;
Hastings; Orleans; Lepanto; Blenheim; Naseby; Pultova; Saratoga;
Valmy; Waterloo; Gettysburg; Mukden; Adrianople;
Mexico&mdash;as blood red peaks dot the darkness. Is warfare and
concomitant hate the natural state of man? The peaks ooze
blood in answer.</p>

<p>Some pessimistic glimmerings of the Epicurean philosophy
seem to scintillate out from the past. And that philosophy,
crystallized in Lucretius’ cynic saying, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo homini lupus</i> (One
man is a wolf to another man) glitters in icicle harshness and
coldness down in the darkness. And yet amidst this general
censure of the heart of man I hear a shrill true cry of self
exculpation. I am not a wolf to man or beast or bird. My
hands are clean; my heart is kind. Am I unique in the human
nature plan? No. May I affirm of self that which I deny
of others? No. My own light illumines the darkness and
leads upward and on.</p>

<p><em>Cease Firing, Lay Down Your Arms</em>, “We speak for those
(dumb animals) who cannot speak for themselves”; “I would
not enter on my list of friends the man who needlessly sets foot
upon a worm”; “He who is not actively kind is cruel”&mdash;are
among the utterances of the hour that tip the farthest pendulum-swing
from old Lucretius’ snarl. Wars must cease. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
searchlight of civilization’s best thought and feelings is turned
full upon war&mdash;showing its hitherto darkly concealed causes;
its concomitant wrongs, sufferings, shamble horrors; its calamitous,
nation-suicidal results. However necessary or inevitable
the arbitrament by the sword may have been in the past, it is
so no longer.</p>

<p>Let wars cease: in the name of all the bloody battlefields from
Marathon to Waterloo; and in pity for all the war-woe from
Egypt’s Memphis down to Mexico&mdash;let wars cease.</p>
